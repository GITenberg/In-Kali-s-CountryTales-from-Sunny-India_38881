Kalighat</h2>

<p>"The five years will be up to-morrow.
When the sun rises next upon the festival
of Kali I shall have completed my
vow."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the holy man been able to say his
prayers or repeat his sacred texts the whole day
long, for there had been constantly before his mind
the knowledge that this was the last day of his self-imposed
sacrifices and that the next day he would
be free from all restraints to do&mdash;what? Over and
over had the thought repeated itself in the man's
mind until now, unconsciously, he had given utterance
to it and the stout, sleek priest of Kali
who chanced to be standing beside his shelter, looked
down upon him in surprise.</p>

<p>"What vow, most holy one?" he courteously inquired.
"For many years thou hast sat here at the
ghat, the most honoured and revered of all the holy
men this side the temple of our Goddess Kali. Was
this thy vow&mdash;to sit thus in ashes?"</p>

<p>The fakir started at the priest's voice, for his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>remarks had been unconscious, and, looking up at
his interrogator, he seemed slowly to comprehend
that he had spoken aloud and that the priest had
heard his words.</p>

<p>"Yes, Priest of Kali," he said, dropping his eyes
and poking the little fire before him with his sacred
tongs.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you of the holy priesthood can answer
a question for me," he added slowly after a moment,
without looking up.</p>

<p>The fat, half-naked priest, not loath to take advantage
of any opportunity to do nothing, especially
when at the same time he was being religious by
talking with a holy man, dropped lazily to the pavement
beside the fakir's rude shelter of a bit of thatch
on four poles and, waving for a hookah from the
rest-house across the narrow street, settled himself to
listen in comfort.</p>

<p>But before the holy man propounded his question,
for a few minutes he seemed to have forgotten about
it. His keen, dark eyes, after turning thoughtfully
from one side to the other of the small paved square
in front of him, looked across the sluggish brown
stream at the foot of the steps to the opposite bank
where a few people were bathing in the water, and
beyond to where were crowded close together the
small mud houses of the native section of a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>Indian city. While he gazed thus, the young priest
took several puffs at the long pipe, leering lazily the
while at two pretty girls who had come from the
street into the square and, pausing before the fakir,
timidly had placed a few pice on the dirty cloth
spread out before him, but, seeing the leer of the
priest, hastened to pull their saris over their faces
and pass hurriedly down the steps to the sacred
Ganges.</p>

<p>The holy man had not noticed the girls, nor did
he seem to see the rest of the crowd of people who
walked back and forth through the little square,
having come to throw flowers upon the river or to
bathe in its waters or, having bathed, to lie down
and rest in Indian fashion in the roofed verandas
charitably provided by rich and merit-seeking Hindus.
He did not seem to see any of them, although so
many of them brought their offerings of fruit and
pice to him that his begging cloth was almost overflowing.
Nor did he notice the presence of an
American tourist who had stepped into the square
and who, with a Murray under one arm and an
umbrella under the other, was endeavouring to keep
an immense sola, topi, from falling over on his nose
while he took a picture of the "freak"; for how
else could a globe-trotting American classify a man
who, naked all but for a small loin cloth, sat cross-legged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>upon a deer's skin, his long hair, matted with
filth into ropes, wound in a scraggy knot upon his
head and his body smeared with ashes from the
small fire that burned before him, the marks of white
upon his forehead, intelligible only to the Hindu,
making his bearded face almost frightful.</p>

<p>Nor did the fakir heed the naked children who
trotted across the pavement at the heels of their
mothers, going to perform the sacred rites at the
river and to secure their children from all harm by a
dip in its holy waters. The old woman, too, who,
scarcely able to hobble along, had placed a little
brass bowl of the dirty, foul water beside him (for
the piece of water near Kali's temple is only a slip of
the Ganges itself and is, therefore, particularly filthy)
received not her usual blessing in return and sank
down near by to wait until the holy man should
notice her.</p>

<p>"Yes, Priest of Kali," the holy one turned from
his gazing, "I have a question that waits an answer.
Listen to my story. I was once a wealthy man,
trained in all the learning of Brahminism. I did
only what our religion allowed; I did all that it required,
in sacrifices to the gods, in presents to their
priests, and even in pilgrimages. But I was wretched
within. I had no peace." As he spoke he laid his
hand upon his heart and his eyes were heavy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span> "On
the day of the great feast five years ago, on this very
spot, after having made my offering to Jaganauth
and to Haunamon and the other gods there," and he
indicated with his dirty hand a little stone building
at his left which contained a shrine to the legless,
armless, hideous god, Jaganauth, and to the red,
shapeless figure known as Haunamon, "I came to
this spot to present my offering to the old man who
had sat here ever since I could remember. But he
was not here. He was gone. They told me that
they had found him that morning lying dead on the
steps there with his feet in the Ganges and that already
his body had been burnt in the burning-ghat
near by. 'What a reward!' I thought, 'to have
died by the side of Mother Gunga. Surely he must
have found peace.'</p>

<p>"'Can I not find peace by following his example?'
The thought came to me suddenly as I
stood here gazing upon his empty shelter and his
neglected fire. I determined at least to try, for, at
any cost, I must find peace! In my zeal and eagerness
at once I stripped off my clothing and smeared
myself with ashes from the fire which the holy man
had kindled but the day before. Leaving my
clothes on the ground underneath this little roof
near the heap of ashes, as a sign that the dead man's
place had been taken, to warn off other possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>devotees from the spot, immediately I passed down
the little street there between the stalls where are
sold the articles needed in the worship of your
goddess. At one I bought the little lamp; at another,
garlands; at another, oil and a brass bowl;
and at the street there I turned aside to buy,
with my last annas, a black kid as a sacrifice for
Kali.</p>

<p>"Through the narrow passage between the houses
that surround the temple of Kali I went in haste,
drawing the bleating kid behind me by a rope.
When I reached the little paved courtyard before
that small but most sacred shrine where dwells the
goddess herself I gave the animal over to the priest.
Then I watched eagerly as he put the little creature's
neck between the posts so that he could not get
away, and, with but one blow of the knife, severed
the head from the body, letting the blood pour forth.
I hastened to catch the precious blood in my brass
bowl. I daubed it upon my forehead. I touched
the sacred slaughter posts with it. I gladly stepped
where it had flowed upon the pavement and reddened
my feet in the sacred flood. Then, as the priest
carried the carcass away and other sacrificers
thronged in, I took my bowl and, mounting the
steps of the holy place where no unclean foot has
ever trod, I saw the door of the shrine open and before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>me stood the Goddess Kali in her black majesty,
with human skulls for a necklace and human arms
for a girdle, her protruding tongue thirsting for
blood. I poured my offering of blood upon her and
with prayers and presentation of flowers and incense,
I invoked her blessing upon me and declared to her
a vow that for five years I would sit at the ghat day
and night; that I would follow all the customs of the
holy men:&mdash;wear no clothes but ashes, eat no food
but fruit, drink no water but that of the sacred
Ganges, and pray without ceasing; and that every
anna that I received as alms I would give to her.</p>

<p>"Now, Priest of this most revered goddess, all this
have I done. I have never left this spot since returning
from offering my vow to her five years ago; I did
not even go home to tell my family, who after several
days traced me here; but I was so changed that
they did not recognize me. Now they mourn me as
dead. Here I have sat for five years upon this skin.
See my legs, how withered they are! See my
body; there is not a clean spot on it! See, I have
drunk nothing but this water," and he held up the
jar of muddy liquid which the old woman had set
down at his side. "I eat nothing but fruit; I think
of nothing but my beads and my sacred book; I
give every pice to your temple. I have kept my
vow. But I am not satisfied. I have not found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>peace. What shall I do? Priest of Kali! What
can I do to find peace?"</p>

<p>The sad heart of the holy man was in his eyes as
he looked at the priest and his voice was pleading.
"If thou dost know, tell me!"</p>

<p>The priest, who had been dulled by his bestiality
so that he was not able to comprehend the soul-longings
of the man before him, had already become
weary of the fakir's earnestness and importunity.
Lazily he pulled himself to his feet, after a last long
suck at the pipe. "Come and be a priest of Kali,"
was his only answer as he turned down the lane
towards the temple of his goddess, with lustful eyes
fixed upon a pretty woman, who, attracted by the
unusual animation of the holy man, had been standing
near by until the priest arose.</p>

<p>The fakir, worn out by the eagerness with which
he had spoken and the unappreciativeness of his listener,
turned wearily to his holy book and his
prayers. He knew the priesthood of Kali; in his
five years at the Kalighat he had heard and seen
strange things which as a Hindu he could not condemn,
but which he knew would not bring peace to
him, even as a priest of Kali, for in his young manhood
he had tried them and had not been at rest.
"I was, indeed, foolish to have talked to the priest
at all," he murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p><p>"Pardon me, holy one," a voice interrupted his
thoughts, the voice of a young man who had been
standing for some time with an open book in his
hand, not reading, but listening to the words of the
fakir. "I heard thy conversation. Hast thou ever
tried the pursuit of wisdom? Study, learn, become
the wisest of men and surely thou wilt become the
most happy. I am a follower of that way."</p>

<p>The holy man, turning, looked fixedly for some
time at the young man. "Son, what means the sad
look in your eyes? Are you yourself happy? Tell
me truly!"</p>

<p>The young man's intelligent but undeniably sad
face was turned full towards the fakir. For a few
moments he seemed to hesitate to reply. At last he
said, "No, holy man, I have not found peace yet.
I have not found happiness yet, but I am only a
student. I am seeking. I study and read at all
times&mdash;but even while I read my heart is not at rest,
I must confess." He turned as he finished speaking
and with bowed head, unmindful of the noise and
confusion of the square about him, went down the lane.</p>

<p>The fakir sighed. "Peace is not found in that
way, poor youth! For I have tried it. I was a
Hindu scholar of note before I became this," and he
gazed at his dirty hands and body with evident
loathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p><p>The old woman, who had waited all this time for
her blessing, said timidly, holding out her hand
towards him, "Holy man, most holy man! Give me
thy blessing, for my son is ill. Tell me how he can
be healed, my only son."</p>

<p>Mechanically the holy man muttered a blessing,
and taking a pinch of ashes from the fire before him,
with a mumbled prayer, dropped them into her hand.
"Put these upon his tongue. Bathe his head in the
holy Gunga water and forget not to offer a kid to
Kali."</p>

<p>"But I cannot offer a kid. I have no money! I
have no money! My son will die! My son will
die!" sobbed the woman.</p>

<p>The holy man looked at her fixedly for a full minute,
realizing her grief and her need. Then with a
quick glance about him he leaned forward. He
swept up the pile of coins on the offering cloth
before him and thrusting them into the woman's
hands whispered: "Go and buy! Go and
buy!"</p>

<p>The woman went quickly, wiping her eyes with
her sari.</p>

<p>The fakir's face became radiant. "Surely that
sweet feeling was peace! Blessed peace! Is this
the end of my quest? Has my soul at last found
rest?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p><p>As suddenly his face darkened. "Yet, yet&mdash;I
should have given that money to the goddess. I
promised in my vow that every anna, above the cost
of my fruit and of the wood for my fire, should be
given to her."</p>

<p>He bowed his head upon his hands.</p>

<p>"I have broken my vow&mdash;on the last day of the
five years I have broken my vow! I am unholy! I
am unholy!"</p>

<p>After a few minutes he raised his bowed head and
seemed to be thinking aloud. "Peace could not
have come in cheating the gods. That strange feeling
when I gave to the woman to relieve her sorrow
could not have been peace&mdash;but it was sweet, very
sweet!" He paused with a half smile which soon,
however, was overcast, for all the joy went out of his
face again as he said, "It must be that I have not
denied myself enough, have not made enough sacrifices.
And I have been unholy! Surely there is
peace for the truly holy. I will try again.&mdash;I will
swear another vow. Take me to Kali!" He called
the last sentence loudly, but ere the people in the
square understood his wish, he remembered that he
had no money, no offering to take; even he, a "holy
man," could not go to Kali's temple to make a vow
without an offering. He must wait until the people
should fill his empty begging cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span></p><p>"After all, it is best thus," he thought. It
would have been useless for him to have gone to
the temple without having planned what new form
of self-torture he must add to his present life, in
his search for peace. "I must plan my vow," he
said.</p>

<p>In the meantime the sun had set and the people
were leaving the ghat. Involuntarily the fakir pulled
a cotton sheet around him and started to add a stick
to his fire, for it was beginning to get chilly. But
suddenly he stopped, dropped the stick from his
hand and threw the cloth from his shoulders, proclaiming
in a loud voice: "For the next five years I
will have no fire at night, nor will I put more clothing
about my body; but I will have a fire by day
when the sun is hot. Moreover I will eat but once
a day and but once a day will I drink water, no matter
how parching the heat. And&mdash;and&mdash;I will hold
my arms above my head all the night! Surely," his
voice sank, "surely these sacrifices will bring me
peace. Surely&mdash;they&mdash;will&mdash;bring&mdash;me&mdash;peace. To-morrow
will be the day to begin my new vow, but,"
he paused, "perchance I can gain my desire sooner
if I begin now. Now, to-night, I will begin to keep
my vow."</p>

<p>In haste the holy man beat out his fire with the
sacred tongs; he threw his cotton sheet towards a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>beggar shivering on a step near by; and with his
eyes turned towards the waters of the sacred Ganges,
just visible in the dim twilight, he raised his arms
high above his head.</p><hr class="chap" />

Shama Sahai</h2>

<p>A little company of pilgrims were trudging
along the hot, dusty road. Where a
large tree offered a resting place, there for a
few minutes, squatting in the shade, the little company
would stop while the mother, taking her naked
baby from her hip, astride of which he had been carried
during the journey, would let him stand beside
her, and the father would take a fresh chew of pan,
spitting out the red juice upon the roadside. But
the young girl of the party would sit apparently unwearied,
with bright, eager eyes fixed upon the road
and with caressing fingers fondling the bracelets
which adorned her arms.</p>

<p>It was an unusual thing for Shama Sahai to be
clad in a gay sari, to have necklaces of beads about
her neck, a glass-set stud in her nose, pretty, brass
rings in her ears, bracelets upon her arms, metal
circlets upon her fingers, large anklets upon her feet,
and rings even on her toes. But most unusual was
it for her to be leaving her village home of mud huts
and with her parents-in-law and baby brother to be
taking a journey; for from early childhood Shama
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>Sahai had been but a despised and neglected widow
in the home of her dead Hindu husband. She knew
that they were going to some place afar off to worship
the god Krishna and that some special blessing
was coming to them for making this journey. She
knew that her father and mother and she herself had
worked hard in the fields that they might earn the
money needed to pay the visit to the sacred city.
She knew, too, that a large portion of this money had
been spent upon her own adornment. So she felt
very proud and very happy, but most of all very
eager to reach the wonderful place to which they
were going. Shama Sahai was young and strong,
accustomed for many of her sixteen years to the heat
of the noonday sun in the fields. To make greater
haste she would offer to carry the baby and settling
more comfortably the bundle which she carried upon
her head, she would take the baby astride upon her
hip and start off at an energetic pace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 295px;">
  <a name="illus07" id="illus07" href="images/illus07.png">
    <img src="images/illus07-tb.png" width="295" height="400" alt="Indian girl" />
  </a>
  <br />
  <span class="caption">&quot;SHAMA SAHAI WAS NOT HAPPY&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>For several days they journeyed thus, at night
sleeping by the roadside, each wrapped in an extra
covering which Shama carried in the bundle on her
head during the day. Often they met other pilgrims,
or sacred fakirs who, each with a pair of tongs
in his hand, would be measuring their length along
the road with naked, ash-smeared bodies, seeking by
such self-torture to win rest for their souls. Sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>they would meet ox-carts loaded with produce
for the city market; at other times, bands of
coolies carrying sugar-cane or bundles of fuel cakes
upon their heads. It was all of interest to Shama
Sahai, who, pulling her sari down over her face,
would peep out between its folds and eagerly
watch every passer-by. Sometimes, however, she
would be frightened as a "chug-chug" would sound
upon the air and a great motor car would whiz by
and all she could see would be a cloud of dust whirling
along before her.</p>

<p>On the long journey before they could reach
Kamadabad Shama was afraid that her pretty finery
would be spoilt, because her sari soon began to get
wrinkled and one of the stones in her prettiest finger
ring fell out. Therefore, every evening, when just
at sundown they stopped in front of a little wayside
temple, the names of whose gods she did not know,
and lost an hour of travelling before dark while they
put flowers upon the necks of the idols, poured a little
oil upon their bodies, and lighted tiny lamps before them,
she begrudged the time. She was not interested
either in the terrible din, the beating upon
gongs and the ringing of bells with which the Hindu
priests awakened their gods for worship. Her
thoughts were of Kamadabad and the wonders that
awaited her there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span></p><p>At last on a bright morning they reached the city
with its narrow, black streets lined with dirty-white,
plastered houses and tiny shops. As the streets were
full of people crowding this way and that, Shama
Sahai kept as close to her parents as she could. At
once the little company hurried to the great temple
which was by far the most wonderful building that
Shama had ever seen. It was enclosed by high
walls and above the gate was a tower tapering upward
many stories, on each story of which stood
figures of gods, many of whom the girl knew and
feared, but others whom she had never seen before.
Passing under this tower they entered a court
and from there went under another tower to another
court and on until, entering a covered building in
the centre, they found the god, a great black figure,
reeking with oil and garlanded with flowers. All
around were young girls, no older than Shama herself,
who, with faces shamelessly uncovered, stood
there alone, without their parents. Priests, almost
naked, were going through ceremonies before the
idol. So dark and weird did it all seem and so many
strange looking people were passing back and forth
that Shama Sahai was half frightened.</p>

<p>After the little company had presented its offerings
to the gods and the father had spoken aside to a
big fat priest who kept looking at Shama Sahai, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>mother announced that they must bathe in the
sacred pool. So they returned to the outer court of
the temple where was a tank about two hundred feet
square containing foul and slimy, but none the less
exceedingly sacred, water. Into this tank they
stepped and with prayers and the reciting of charms
bathed with the throng of worshippers. Carefully
they washed out their mouths with the filthy water
and then drank of it. During all this time the fat
priest kept close to them and it seemed to Shama
that his eyes were always upon her. His were not
attractive eyes nor was his face pleasing and the girl
was thoroughly frightened when, after the cleansing
ceremony, he bade them good-bye with a caressing
hand upon her shoulder while a bestial smile distorted
his face.</p>

<p>That night Shama Sahai was not happy although
she had reached the place where she had so longed
to be. The memory of the priest's face haunted her
and she could not keep from thinking of those girls
in the temple. Towards morning her mother was
taken ill. And the groans of the woman kept her
awake. She stole out upon the door-step, but the
sounds of the city were so strange that, little country
girl that she was, she drew back and preferred to lie
down again beside her moaning mother.</p>

<p>The mother was no better in the morning. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>the man of whom they rented the lodging suggested
that Shama Sahai should go up to the house of a
white memsahib who could make people well and
ask for help. The memsahib could do wonderful
things, the man said, and without doubt would cure
the sick woman. Although very timid, Shama could
not refuse to go for her mother's sake. So, taking
her baby brother on her hip and guided by the landlord's
child, she took her way along the narrow
streets until she came to a high brick wall with a
large open gateway. Within she saw a number of
people standing before a long, low building. The
boy, her guide, having pointed to that building and
by so doing having done his whole duty, set himself
to the pleasant task of chasing some chickens which
were running at large in the compound. Shama
Sahai had to approach the building alone. As she
came nearer the little knot of people, she noticed
that every one of them looked ill and almost every
one carried a little bottle in his hand. Through the
open door of the building she could see a white
memsahib in a blue striped dress, sitting at a little
table, writing slips of paper and handing them out to
the sick people. Occasionally the lady would touch
one of the patients and he would run out his tongue.
It was all very queer but interesting to Shama and
even the baby watched quietly. When Shama's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>turn came to enter, she was so embarrassed that she
could hardly speak, but, encouraged by the memsahib's
speaking kindly to her in her own tongue,
she finally stammered out a brief but none too lucid
account of her mother's illness. But the lady seemed
to understand. After writing in a book and speaking
to a native woman who stood behind a sort of
table near by, with more kind words she put a small
bottle of medicine into the girl's hands. Assured
that her mother would soon be well and with orders
to come the next day and report the condition of
the patient, Shama Sahai went home very much
pleased.</p>

<p>But the mother did not get well at once and for
several days the girl paid a daily visit to the dispensary,
each time losing a little of her timidity and each
time being more attracted by the white lady who
was so kind to her and called her by name and who,
one day when there had been but a few patients and
Shama Sahai had lingered behind, had told her beautiful
stories about a new god that was not an ugly
black image.</p>

<p>However, after a while the mother did get so much
better that she could go to the temple again and
Shama Sahai's visits to the dispensary ceased.
She hoped that they would soon go home. By this
time so frightened had the girl become in the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>city that she was almost as anxious to leave Kamadabad
as she had been to reach there.</p>

<p>One night as she lay, apparently asleep, in her
corner of the room near the outside door, she heard
her father and mother talking as they came up on
the door-step. She opened her eyes and listened.</p>

<p>"We'll go home to-morrow. I made final arrangements
with the priest to-day. My, but he's a
hard one to drive a bargain with! We will settle
the money part in the morning so that we can get a
good start before night," said her father.</p>

<p>Shama Sahai gave a sigh of relief at the prospects
of an early start for home and was about to close her
eyes so that she might sleep and be rested for the
journey, when she heard her mother say: "Where
are we to leave her?"</p>

<p>"The priest said to take her to the inner court of
the red temple with the offerings. He will perform
the necessary ceremonies in a short time and we can
leave her there," answered the man. "I wanted it
done to-day so that we could get off on the road in
the cool of the morning, but he would not have it
so."</p>

<p>"Have you bought our food yet? We won't
need so much rice without Shama, you know," said
the mother.</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten that when that's just what we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>are getting rid of her for, you may be sure. Yes, I
bought it this afternoon. We'll miss the girl in carrying
the load, I suppose, but you can carry it and
the baby too just as well as not. How much better
it is to get rid of a widow in this way and have one
less to feed than to have the cursed creature always
around in the way. We'll not go hungry now. A
good business we've done here at Kamadabad, old
woman, although you did waste a lot of time and
money by being sick, for of course we had to pay
extra for the longer stay. That old rupee-snatcher
of a landlord wouldn't give in an anna because you
had been sick. He said that he really ought to have
charged more, for when people are sick they lie
down longer and so wear out his floor more quickly.
You were a fine one, you were, to get sick!" the
man snarled.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you wouldn't have been here at all or
have thought of bringing the girl, if I hadn't suggested
it," snapped the old woman in her turn.</p>

<p>Shama Sahai lay perfectly quiet as the couple,
still mumbling unkind remarks at each other, came
in and lay down on the floor. She scarcely breathed
for fear that they should find out that she was awake.
But when she knew that they were asleep, she crept
out-of-doors and darting around a corner sank down
upon some steps. She knew from what she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>overheard that her parents-in-law were planning to
go home in the morning without her and that the
priest was to have her. As she remembered the evil,
swollen face of the man who had watched her that
first day at the temple, she shuddered and, drawing
her sari more closely about her, crept farther back
into the doorway.</p>

<p>Only one thought would come&mdash;she must run
away where the priest could not get her and she must
go at once. Peeping out from the doorway, she
looked up and down the street. No one was astir;
only a quiet form here and there on the little porches
could be seen in the dim light of the street lamps.
She would go to the white memsahib. The memsahib
and the new god would surely save her.</p>

<p>Like a spirit the girl took her flight through the
streets, the lightness of her footfall awaking not the
most restless of the sleepers.</p>

<p>When she reached the familiar compound, she did
not hesitate, but, running up to the veranda, shook
the sleeping chokidar.</p>

<p>"Where is the memsahib? Quick, tell me, quick!"</p>

<p>The watchman, ashamed at having been caught
asleep and thinking it nothing strange that a girl
should call the doctor in the night, hastened to show
Shama Sahai the stairs leading to the roof of the
bungalow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span></p><p>"You'll find her up there. She always sleeps on
the roof in the hot weather."</p>

<p>The girl was soon beside the doctor's cot and with
frightened sobs was telling her story. "I've come
to you and you must save me," were her final
words.</p>

<p>Events happen quickly sometimes, especially when
an energetic woman is helping them along. As the
earliest morning train pulled out from Kamadabad
for Mattera, a native Christian woman with a Hindu
girl, disguised in the slightly different garb of a
Christian, was on board, and the white doctor-memsahib
was taking her chota hazri with fear in her
heart.</p>

<p>What would be the fate of the poor young girl
who had fled to her for refuge? That was the question
which was troubling the doctor that morning.
Although she was used to witnessing crises in people's
lives with real, professional calm, this morning
her outward calmness was assumed, for this was a
case which her degree of M. D. had, perhaps, not
qualified her to handle.</p>

<p>Throughout the long day the doctor waited expecting
searchers for the girl, but no one came to
make any inquiries of her. As she was leaving her
compound gate towards evening for her daily exercise,
she met a man and a woman, the latter carrying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>on her hip a baby whom the doctor recognized.
The man was saying in Hindustani to the woman:</p>

<p>"The priest stole her. I know he stole her!
Well, it's much the same after all, I suppose, for
we're rid of her anyway. Of course he pretended
he had not seen her and was angry because I had
not brought her. Well, well; it's hard to deal with
the priests."</p>

<p>"Whoever has her, may bad luck go with her!"
exclaimed the woman.</p>

<p>But the woman's malediction did not bring fear to
the doctor who, stopping short in her walk, could
scarcely restrain a shout of joy. For this man and
woman were Shama Sahai's parents-in-law going
home without her, believing that the priest had
stolen the girl. Instead of going on to the river for
her usual evening constitutional, the doctor-memsahib
hastened to the station where she caught the last
afternoon train for Mattera that she might tell Shama
Sahai that she was safe.</p><hr class="chap" />

Old Sarah</h2>

<p>"Here comes Old Sarah!" A shrill voice
shouted the news through the open door
into the mud house where the small
boy's mother squatted at work, with one long,
rounded stone crushing the curry seeds upon another
large, flat stone that stood on the mud floor. At the
call the mother dropped the long stone from her
hand and, springing to her feet, hastily followed her
naked boy out upon the street of the village. Old
Sarah was a new friend who recently had come often
to the village, telling the people stories and singing
songs to them. But she never had come oftener
than twice a week and she had been there only the
day before. So the woman wondered what could
have brought her back so soon.</p>

<p>The boy, meantime, had been running up and
down the short street, clapping his hands and shouting,
"Old Sarah has come! Old Sarah has come!"
as Old Sarah herself had taught him to do at her arrival
so that the people might know at once that she
had come and she might not have to wait for an
audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span></p><p>"Where is she?" called the mother after the running
child, for she had looked up and down the road
and failed to see the old woman.</p>

<p>"Why, there she is!" said the boy coming up.
"Don't you see her sitting there by the road?"</p>

<p>"That's not Old Sarah! I never saw her sitting
by the road like that."</p>

<p>"Yes it is! Yes it is!" and the boy danced off in
the direction of the sitting figure, kicking up the
dust with his bare feet in his eagerness to reach the
side of the old lady who always had some sweet
for him hidden away in her bag. His mother followed
after him and several other people, also, who
had come from their homes at his familiar call.</p>

<p>"Why, it is Old Sarah, sure enough! What can
be the matter with her?" exclaimed the woman to a
neighbour as they approached.</p>

<p>The exclamation was not unnatural, for the usually
active old lady who, unwearied, had come trudging
into their village week after week, after a walk of
five miles, now sat all bent over on the ground with
her sari-covered head bowed upon her arms.</p>

<p>The noise of the little crowd as it drew near
aroused the old woman, who, letting the sari slide
back from a head well sprinkled with gray, raised
to them a face white and drawn. The people were
astounded, for never in their acquaintance had she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>shown them aught but a face full of life and joy.
Now she looked weak and haggard.</p>

<p>"I am sick," she said, answering the unasked
question which she saw in their faces. "You are
my good friends; so I came to you for help."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me help her!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Bring her to my house!" called another.</p>

<p>"I will care for her myself," said the child's
mother as several women stepped up to raise the old
woman to her feet.</p>

<p>They had helped her along some little way and
the children were following close behind or crowding
ahead to tell the rest of the villagers, when the
head man met them.</p>

<p>Looking at the old woman, he said sharply,
"What is the matter with her?"</p>

<p>The crowd stopped, out of respect to the head
man, and each looked at the other, not knowing
what to say. Then the old woman herself looked up.
With a feeble attempt at the usual gay salaam with
which she always greeted the chief, she answered his
question.</p>

<p>"It is the cholera," she said.</p>

<p>"The cholera!" frightened voices screamed.</p>

<p>The hands that had so tenderly been guiding the
woman's feeble steps were suddenly withdrawn.
The women fled from her, dragging their children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>with them while the larger youngsters ran down the
street, crying, "Old Sarah has the cholera! Old
Sarah has the cholera!"</p>

<p>The cry was passed on from one person to another
for miles along the road, for never are the roads of
India, except in the hottest part of the day, without
a throng of travellers.</p>

<p>The old woman, who, thus suddenly left unsupported,
had fallen in a limp heap in the middle of the
road, lay there for some time until the sun became
unendurable and made its rays felt even in her acute
suffering. She raised her head. Not a person was
in sight. The little village was deserted. It consisted
only of a few palm-leaf huts on each side of the street,
shaded by cocoanut trees, and could be taken in at a
glance. Old Sarah's head fell upon her hands.
What could she do? If she stayed in the road her
suffering would be more intense; although she expected
to die now that her friends had deserted her,
still she wanted to die with as little torture as possible.</p>

<p>About six feet away from her was the open door
of a tiny hut. The shade within looked very inviting.
Summoning all the strength she had, Old
Sarah crawled upon her hands and knees, slowly,
painfully, to the door and dropped at full length on
the hard mud floor. It was cool there but, oh, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>lonely! No one to care for her! no one to supply
her wants! no one to be with her when she should
die! and no one to give her body Christian burial
before the pariah dogs should tear it to pieces!
She heard a noise at the door. With a flash of joy
in her heart to think that some one had returned to
help her, painfully turning her head, she saw&mdash;only
the sacred bull of the village sticking an inquiring
nose into the door. Perhaps there might be something
within that he might feed upon, for he, according
to Hindu custom, was privileged to help
himself to whatever he could find anywhere. With
disappointed heart, Old Sarah let her head roll back
and closed her eyes, although the thought passed
through her mind that the bull might enter the
house and trample upon her in his search for food in
the tiny room; but if he should, it would bring her
only a quick release from her pain. Then the pain
and suffering became so great that she could not even
think. The bull, however, evidently seeing nothing to
please his appetite within the hut, turned away from
the door and went on down the street, nosing along
the front of every house until he reached the last
one where a woman in her haste to flee from the
cholera had overturned a basket of pea-pods and left
them in a heap on the mud floor of the porch before
the house&mdash;a fine meal for a hungry bull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span></p><p>The minutes flew by and became hours; only the
moaning from the house near the middle of the
street disturbed the hot hush of the midday.</p>

<p>A cat crept into the hut and sniffed at the
woman's feet; a dog peered in at the dark object on
the floor; but no human being came near.</p>

<p>When the sun was no more than an hour from
setting, there sounded the rumble of wheels. A
wooden ox-cart, driven by a scantily-clad, very dark
native, and drawn by a pair of the gray, humped
bullocks of the district, entered the street at the head
of the village. The bullocks were brought to a halt
at once and a woman's head appeared from under
the rounded straw covering of the cart.</p>

<p>"Where is she? Do you see her?" she asked the
man.</p>

<p>"There is no one in sight," he replied. "But,
hark, I hear a moan!"</p>

<p>"She must be in that house there," he added after
listening a moment, pointing as he spoke with a
thin, black finger to the house into which Old Sarah
had crawled.</p>

<p>He drove his bullocks on down the narrow street
until he pulled up in front of the hut. Then the
young woman, for it was a young Tamil woman in
the cart, with beautiful face and straight, lithe figure,
leapt to the ground and ran into the house, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>pretty red sari fluttering behind her. The man in
the cart sat still, watching the open door, the eternal
sadness of the Hindu in his face.</p>

<p>The woman was gone for some time but, finally,
looked out of the door. "I have done all I
can for her. She is very bad. I think we had better
take her to the hospital in the city, for there
they may be able to save her life. Get the cart
ready," she called.</p>

<p>As she disappeared again, the man got down
slowly from the front of the cart and, having got in
at the back, arranged some blankets so as to make it
as comfortable as possible for the sick woman. Then
he went into the house with another blanket in his
arms. And in a few minutes the two came out
again, carrying Old Sarah in the blanket between
them, and they laid her as carefully as they could in
the cart.</p>

<p>All this was not done in silence, for all of the time
the young woman kept talking, sometimes addressing
the sufferer, sometimes the driver, and sometimes
herself. "Poor old woman!" she said. "To think
that the cowards all ran away and left her like this
after the kindness she had shown them. She has
walked those five miles, really ten, there and back,
day after day, to tell them about her new religion
and to help them; for she never came that she did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>not help the women in their work, or bring the children
some sweets, or teach the people something
new. Dear old soul! And after all the love you
have given them, just in your hour of need they all
forsook you! Just wait until I get a chance and I'll
tell them what I think about such actions; indeed,
what every decent person would think! They
pretended to be so fond of her too; she really
thought they loved her as much as if she had been
their mother. That's the way with these black
heathen!"</p>

<p>"Why didn't she come to you?" asked the man
as they got the old woman settled with her head on
the young woman's lap and he had climbed up in
front to prod the bullocks to a start.</p>

<p>"Poor old soul, I never gave her any reason to
think that I believed her preachings although she
has come faithfully every week to visit me. I liked
to tease her and hear her funny answers. I liked to
ask her hard questions about her new religion. She
would pucker her face all up and think and think
until she had answered every one. Alas, I never let
her know that her religion touched my heart and
that I believe in Jesus Christ! I never even let her
know that I loved her. Of course she would not
come to me for help. But I do love her. She was
so funny and so full of life and odd sayings that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>just had to tease her, that was all. Now, now I fear
it is too late to tell her!" she ended with a sob.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she will live, do you?" she asked
the servant a moment later as he had turned around
to look at the old woman and they both were gazing
down upon her face, drawn and haggard, with lips
parted in a moan.</p>

<p>"I fear not," said the man. "Have you given her
from the bottle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the very medicine she brought me a month
ago when the cholera threatened our village." She
pulled a bottle from the bosom of her sari. "I'll
give her another dose now; surely if one dose is
good, two will be better."</p>

<p>She tipped the bottle to the old woman's lips who
mechanically swallowed a very little. It seemed to
revive her for she opened her eyes and murmured:
"Who is this? Where am I?"</p>

<p>The other, bending over her, answered, "This is
Jessa. Don't you know Jessa? I've come to take
care of you. You will be all right soon."</p>

<p>"Jessa! Who is Jessa?" the weak voice asked
while the big eyes stared up at the girl, unseeing.</p>

<p>"Don't you know Jessa, the girl at Bindy, the
chief's daughter whom you go to teach every week?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she wouldn't come to help me. She
doesn't love me and she makes fun of my God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span></p><p>"Sarah, dear Old Sarah!" the young woman
raised the old woman's head from her lap and, gazing
into her eyes, seemed to draw her back to sight.
"Sarah, it is Jessa and she loves you, and&mdash;and&mdash;Sarah,"
the girl added softly, "she loves your
God."</p>

<p>A brightness as of renewed life suffused the face
of the old woman. "God be thanked!" she tried to
shout, but the shout fell away into a murmur and
the hands, which she had tried to clap as was her
custom when overjoyed, fell back at her sides. But
although she became again unconscious, the smile
of joy remained upon her face and lighted up the
thin, dark features surrounded by the straggling
gray locks and made her face beautiful, as beautiful
for the moment as the face, young and perfect of
feature, that bent over her.</p>

<p>"She is dying!" said the man. Stopping his bullocks
as he spoke he slid from his seat and began to
fumble under the blankets.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Nado?" called the girl.</p>

<p>"Here is a shrine. I will pray for the life of the
old woman and offer a handful of rice to the god."</p>

<p>"Nado," a slim brown hand was laid on his big
black one and prevented him from opening the rice
bag, "Nado, she is a Christian. I, too, am a Christian
now. We cannot pray for her life at a heathen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>shrine. Sit in your place, Nado, and I will pray to
our God."</p>

<p>The man did not get up into his place but stood
and with wide, interested eyes watched the girl as,
laying the old woman's head gently back in her
lap, she freed her hands and clasping them to
heaven, raised her eyes and prayed. The words
were the words of the young girl herself but the
gestures were copied from Old Sarah as she had
prayed many, many times in the girl's presence.
One, not impressed by the solemnity of the moment,
would have laughed at the grotesque motions of her
hands and head as she prayed.</p>

<p>"Oh, most great God, most great of all the gods,"
said the girl. "Let Old Sarah live. She is a good
woman. Never has she harmed any one. Her
whole life has been given to helping others. Save
Old Sarah's life, I pray. I will bring Thee an offering
of the best I have, if Thou wilt spare her life and
let her live. Take the awful pain away from her.
Let her sleep and let her rest and do, oh God, let
her live. I will bring Thee cocoanuts and sweets,
rice and a young kid, if Thou wilt spare her life.
For Jesus Christ's sake. Amen!"</p>

<p>The girl, unconscious of the absurd way that she
had mixed the ideas of her old heathenism with the
words and thoughts of the new religion she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>learned from the old woman, unclasped her hands
and with a smile looked down upon the face in her
lap. Already it seemed to her that her prayer was
being answered, for the sick woman's breath seemed
to come more easily and the moaning had ceased.
As the girl was absorbed in watching the effect of
her prayer, the man took a handful of rice from the
bag, without attracting attention, and slipped to the
side of the road where under a tree stood a wayside
shrine. Pouring out the rice before the ugly
image and bowing three times in front of it, he
hurriedly muttered some unintelligible words and
climbed back into the wagon. There was a gleam
of satisfaction on his face as he started the bullocks
again, for he had done what he could to save the life
of the old woman whom he, as a respected servant
in the family of the chief, had seen often about their
home but to whose preaching he had never had time
to listen.</p>

<p>To the city and then through the city to the
hospital was a long ride in the lumbering ox-cart
but it was not a particularly hard ride to any of the
three, for native Indians prefer hard seats and hard
beds to springs and cushions. And already the old
woman was resting so quietly that the girl thought
her prayer had been answered and the man felt that
his offering had been accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span></p><p>At the hospital a nurse took charge of the sick
woman but she would not let the girl enter. So the
latter quietly placed a kiss upon the old woman's
forehead and turned away, confident that in a short
time she would see Old Sarah again in her own
village, for she had prayed.</p>

<p>As it was night and the oxen were tired, the girl
could not return to her village at once. Besides
there was one thing more that she must do in the
city. Therefore they turned aside to the marketplace
where the farmers slept under their carts.
There they made themselves comfortable for the
night, after the driver had cooked them a little meal
at a fire of twigs and dung-cakes. The girl kept in
the cart with her sari drawn up over her face, for
such was her custom in the big city. But later,
when she was rolled up in the blankets, she felt very
secure with Nado asleep under the pole of the cart
and the bullocks chewing their cuds beside him.</p>

<p>When morning came, when the bullocks had been
yoked up again and all things were ready for the
start, she said:</p>

<p>"Nado, we must tell Old Sarah's mistress. I don't
know where she is but we must find her. She lives
in a big house and takes care of a lot of little orphan
children, for Sarah has often told me about them and
her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span></p><p>It was strange, but in only a few minutes they had
found the place where the little orphan children
lived, for the natives seemed to know the compound
well. And a few minutes later Jessa stood before a
sweet-faced English woman, but so embarrassed by
the memsahib's presence that she scarcely dared
raise her eyes. Only thoughts of Old Sarah and her
love for this white lady gave her courage.</p>

<p>"Memsahib," she said in a timid voice, "Old
Sarah is very ill with the cholera. We have taken
her to the hospital."</p>

<p>"Old Sarah ill with cholera!" the English woman
exclaimed in amazement. "She has been gone since
day before yesterday. She never was gone so long
alone before and we have been worried; but I did
not dream of cholera! She is in the hospital?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Memsahib. But I think she will get well,"
the girl added hastily as she saw the lady's anxiety.
"I am sure she will get well, for I&mdash;I&mdash;prayed," she
faltered.</p>

<p>"And I gave an offering to the gods," said the
man servant in a pleased tone to himself, for he was
listening interestedly, having followed the girl to the
door.</p>

<p>"Get my topi, boy, and order the gari quickly,"
the memsahib called to her bearer. "I must go to
Old Sarah at once. Where did you find her, child?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span></p><p>So while the memsahib waited for her topi and
the gari, Jessa told her the story of how Old Sarah
had gone to the village to her friends for help but
how they had fled from her and left her to die; how
one of the frightened people had come to the village
of which her father was head man and had told
them; and how she herself, because she loved Old
Sarah on account of the loving teaching she had received
from her, how she had taken her servant and
cart and gone to save the old woman's life. She
told the lady, too, of the condition in which she had
found Old Sarah, of the journey to the city, and of
the reception at the hospital. As she finished telling
her story, she repeated her assurance that the
old woman would live because she, Jessa, had prayed
to God.</p>

<p>The memsahib praised the girl for her bravery and
thanked her for her kindness to Old Sarah who was
very dear to the English lady's heart. And as the
gari came up just then she urged them to remain
until her return from the hospital, but the girl felt
that she must hurry back, since she knew that Old
Sarah would be all right now. So they said good-bye
and Jessa, having climbed into the cart, was
trundled away by the faithful bullocks and the still
more faithful Nado, whose gentle prodding of the
bullocks was essential to their progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span></p><p>Meantime the memsahib had entered her gari and
was being driven as fast as the ponies could take
her to the hospital. There she was met by a nurse
who said that she knew nothing of the case that the
lady spoke of. Another nurse was called who knew
nothing of such a woman as Old Sarah. The lady,
however, would not be turned aside; the records
must be searched. And searched they were. The
nurses discovered that a cholera case had been
brought in late the evening before, that the woman
had died towards morning, and that already her body
had been for some time in the hospital morgue.</p>

<p>"You must get her out at once," said the lady,
"for she is not dead."</p>

<p>The nurses who had been uninterested until that
moment then looked at the English lady in mild
amazement, for how could a person who had been in
the dead-house for several hours be still alive? But
the lady was well known to them by reputation and
they yielded to her wishes. At her demand they
called the head nurse who, because she, too, knew
much about this lady, revoked all hospital rules and
permitted her to enter the morgue with them.</p>

<p>There lay Old Sarah's form, covered with a sheet,
upon the floor with other corpses. The familiar
gray hair drew the memsahib's eyes at once. She
pulled back the sheet and felt for the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span></p><p>"We'll work over her. I do not think she is
dead."</p>

<p>With incredulity not only in their hearts but
written plainly upon their faces, the nurses had the
body removed to an empty room. And then, because
the little memsahib was a woman of such
mighty spirit, they fell to work.</p>

<p>Old Sarah was not dead, although she had been for
several hours numbered among the dead. Gradually
circulation was restored. When the signs of life
became unmistakable the nurses worked zealously to
make up for the awful wrong that had almost been
done. In a big, busy hospital, especially during times
of stress, things sometimes are done in a hurry and
mistakes are sometimes made.</p>

<p>The memsahib did not leave for several hours.
When the dear old eyes opened at last, they looked
around in wonder until they rested upon the memsahib's
face. Then a glad light shone from them
and an eager voice whispered: "Oh, Memsahib, is
this heaven?"</p>

<p>"No, Sarah, this is not heaven. You are still on
earth with me, thank God!"</p>

<p>"I didn't think it looked exactly like heaven,"
the old woman added a little later as she looked
around at the bare walls, "but with Jesus and you,
Memsahib, it would be heaven in any kind of place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span></p><p>"I thought I was dead," she kept murmuring,
evidently unable to get the idea out of her head.</p>

<p>"No, Sarah," the memsahib finally assured her,
"you are very much alive and just to convince you
I will scold you a little. Why, oh, why, Sarah, did
you not come to me when you were taken ill?"</p>

<p>"Memsahib, Old Sarah knew she had the cholera
and she could not expose the memsahib and the dear,
little orphan children to it; so she just took her
burial clothes and went away, thinking that her
friends at Yenna, for whom she had travelled so
many, many miles in her old age to tell them about
Jesus, would take her in. But they ran away and
left Old Sarah to die all alone."</p>

<p>"Were you not sorry then that you had not told
me?" urged her mistress.</p>

<p>"No, Memsahib, not even then, for it was better
that Old Sarah should die all alone than that the
memsahib and the dear, orphan children should die
too."</p>

<p>"You precious old woman!" The memsahib,
sinking on her knees by the bed with her arms
around the thin, brown shoulders, implanted a kiss
upon the gray hair. "That is more than a white
person would have done!" she said under her breath.</p>

<p>And as the English woman looked upon Old
Sarah's happy face and remembered the happy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>trustful face of the young girl who had saved this
life and declared that the old woman would live
because of prayer, the memsahib realized that no
hearts in the world were whiter before God than
those of these brown people who loved Him well
enough to be willing to lay down their lives for
others. In beauty of form and feature these brown
people often surpass the white races and she felt that
with the love of the true God in their hearts they
might surpass the white races, also, in the beauty of
their lives and of their love.</p><hr class="chap" />

A Son of the Law</h2>

<p>On an afternoon in the early days of the
British occupancy of India, Blackmore-Sahib
sat alone at the big desk in his study,
in his hand a report which had just reached him from
one of his districts. At his elbow the tea tray was
untouched, although at this hour of the afternoon he
was usually stretched out in a rattan chair in the
living-room with the punkah swinging over him, the
latest magazine, three months old at that, in his
hand, and the tea tray already replaced on the small
table beside his chair by the cigar service holding
cigarettes all neatly rolled ready for his match. It
was not because the report was urgent that he had
forsaken his accustomed ease to prove it up; nor was
it that he was particularly interested in the task, for
apparently he was forcing himself to go over the lines
of type and up and down the columns of figures.
As his pencil reached the bottom of a column it
would almost drop from his listless fingers until, with
a start, he would begin upon the next row as if in
great haste.</p>

<p>The bearer, entering the room noiselessly, saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>untouched tea tray standing just as he had left it a
half hour before and looked anxiously at his master's
face. But without disturbing his master he removed
it and turned to the side table where stood the tobacco
service. Not a cigarette was rolled! He
clumsily attempted to prepare some but none of his
efforts were really successful. However, he put
several bulky ones in a saucer and placed them near
his master's hand. Still in silence but with many
backward glances at the man bending over the
slowly-moving pencil, the boy left the room.</p>

<p>As the boy closed the door, the man dropped the
pencil upon the desk, put his hand to his head for a
second, and then arose. He walked to the door into
the living-room and seemed to listen for an instant;
then he went back to the desk.</p>

<p>The servant, evidently having heard his master's
step, entered with fresh tea and toast.</p>

<p>"Is she better?"</p>

<p>As the boy set the tray down he replied hesitatingly,
"No, Sahib, she is still groaning."</p>

<p>"You fool, don't you suppose I can hear that?
She has groaned incessantly since last night."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" The man asked the question
of himself as he turned half around towards the
veranda door.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <a name="illus08" id="illus08" href="images/illus08.jpg">
    <img src="images/illus08-tb.jpg" width="400" height="303" alt="English gent in shop seeing Indian lady" />
  </a>
  <br />
  <span class="caption">&quot;IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Won't the Sahib have some tea?" suggested the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>boy timidly, for like every native-born this man
feared his stalwart English master.</p>

<p>Blackmore-Sahib held out his hand without turning
back from the door. "Yes, I will take a cup.
Perhaps it will steady me a bit."</p>

<p>"Poor little Nona!" he sighed as he took the
cup.</p>

<p>He gulped down the tea hurriedly and reached for
a cigarette. But as his eyes fell on the clumsy ones
in the saucer, they filled with tears and he walked
quickly out upon the veranda without taking one.</p>

<p>Up and down he paced unheeding the streaks of
sunshine which found their way in through the vines
and fell upon his unprotected head.</p>

<p>"Poor Nona! Poor little girl!" he groaned.
How skillfully she had always rolled his cigarettes,
just to his taste! how daintily she had served his cup
of tea! and how quietly she had sat every afternoon
beside him, never disturbing his nap or reading!
"Poor little Nona!" he sighed, for she might never
sit beside him again. He could hear her groans now
from the bedroom at the other side of the great living-room.
Pitiable, heart-breaking little groans they
were! He could not trust himself even to go to the
door and look in upon her.</p>

<p>And yet he did not really love her. Nona had
made Blackmore-Sahib's life very comfortable for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>the last ten years and he could not bear to think that
she was suffering and probably would die. He did
not want to lose his little Indian wife and her affectionate
care for him, though of course she was his
"wife" only according to the customs of many white
men in dark lands. As he paced up and down he
remembered how, when he had been sent by the
government to this city in the heart of India away
from every European association, he had rebelled
until, seeing a pair of black eyes peeping from the
doorway of a certain mud house, he had become very
much interested in that section of the city although
it belonged to a low caste of Hindus. He remembered
how for several evenings he had taken his
evening walk in that locality and furtively watched
that house door in which he again saw framed for a
second a beautiful Indian face and a slender, lithe
Indian figure in a red sari. After a few more visits
he had several conversations with the men of the
neighbourhood and had learned that the man who
lived in that house was, as they all were, of low
caste and desperately poor. Finally he had met the
man himself whom he heard loudly lamenting because
he could not afford to marry off his beautiful
daughters. "Why, a wedding costs many rupees
nowadays!" he had heard him say.</p>

<p>So the sahib by a little courteous inquiry had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>learned that the man had three unmarried daughters.
By further courteous and diplomatic conversation he
had conveyed to the father the idea that if he, the
sahib, could have his choice of the three girls he
would pay a dowry for one of them. After several
evenings of discussion and bargaining the old man
slowly and cautiously had consented, but the matter
of giving the sahib his choice had been a trifle difficult
even among the low caste. But, finally, having
bidden the sahib stand at the other corner of the
street where he could see without being particularly
noticeable, on the evening the bargain was sealed, the
old man had called his daughters one at a time to the
door of the house on some trifling pretext. It had
been only a glimpse, but as the third girl disappeared
from the doorway, Blackmore-Sahib had been satisfied.
On the very next evening, having promised to
pay a sufficient number of rupees to marry off both
of the other daughters, the Englishman had had the
satisfaction of seeing a little draped figure enter a
covered ekka and be driven away towards his bungalow.</p>

<p>He could remember, even after ten years, how the
ekka had driven up to his door and how he, having
reached the door before her arrival, would not pay
the promised money until the girl's veil had been
lifted and he had seen for himself that no trickery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>had been played upon him and that this was the one
of his choice. She had been very young, very
timid, and very beautiful. He remembered that,
cross, burly chap though he was, he had delighted to
tease her out of her shyness and teach her the little
ways by which she could make him happy and his
bungalow a home. She had been an ignorant native
girl, as the majority of Indian girls are, but she had
soon learned to love him and she had always been
beautiful to look upon.</p>

<p>They had not been married. That was not necessary
in those days in the East. He had given her a
good home and in doing that he had done his whole
duty. Yet he had never mentioned her in his letters
to England, for "they would not understand." Indeed,
he had half expected until the last two years
to go back to England and marry a fine girl whom
he had known in boyhood. But when the time had
drawn near he had decided to stay here as he was;&mdash;for
what would become of Nona? He could not
keep her, too, for even he did not think that way of
living right. He sometimes longed for the green
meadows and the hawthorne bush and the skylark,
nevertheless he remained in India, for he could not
take Nona and he could not leave her.</p>

<p>But now it seemed as if Nona were going to leave
him. If she should die, he would be free to go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>England to marry his childhood friend, for a recent
letter from his brother had told him that Elizabeth
was still unmarried and mistress of her own estate.
But now, of a sudden, he did not want to go; he did
not want to marry. Indeed, he did not want anything
but to stay here with Nona. He wanted
Nona! She must not die! He needed her.</p>

<p>"Sahib!" A soft voice arrested his step and
Nona's ayah besought him: "Sahib, she is no
better. May I get the memsahib? I think she can
help her."</p>

<p>"What memsahib?" he asked, his voice gruff with
emotion.</p>

<p>"The missionary memsahib, master. Please let
me get her."</p>

<p>"A missionary! Would a missionary come to
my house?" he asked in scorn.</p>

<p>Blackmore-Sahib had seen the missionary lady
often, for she was one of the very few Europeans in
the city, but he never had spoken to her. He knew
missionary principles and he felt that he and Nona
in her eyes were worse than the Hindus "in their
blindness." He had always avoided a missionary's
path; now he would not ask for help! Even if he
should humble his pride and do so, he felt that no
Christian would come to him, for were not he and
Nona without the law?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span></p><p>"No, she would not come," he said emphatically.</p>

<p>"Yes, master, she will come. I know she will
come. See how ill my mistress is! Hear her
moans!" and the faithful ayah wrung her hands in
grief. "Oh, let me go to get her."</p>

<p>"Is she a doctor?" he asked. "Does she give
medicine?" he went on, trying to make the native
woman understand.</p>

<p>"No, she is not a doctor, but she gives medicines,"
the woman replied enigmatically.</p>

<p>There was no doctor within reach. If this woman
could help Nona, had he any right to let his pride
keep him from at least asking for her help? Blackmore-Sahib
reasoned it out slowly. Although he
was sure that she would not come, he must do all
that he could to help the sick woman and so he
must ask the missionary to come.</p>

<p>"Go!" he said finally to the ayah and as she sped
down the road he continued his pacing and his
thoughts. His thoughts turned strangely, after the
interruption, to his boyhood home and his boyhood
days when even a lie, a wrong word, or an unkind
deed had hurt him almost as much as his mother.
But his mother had died when he was only a lad
and after that had come school and then India and&mdash;Nona.</p>

<p>The change from the rigid morality of a well-trained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>boy living under the eye of a law-abiding
people, to the moral thoughtlessness and neglect of a
man far away from the reign of aught but the law of
the conqueror among an inferior people; the change
from the conventional obedience to the social customs
of a Christian land, to the unconventional disregard
of all Christian customs in a heathen land,
had come so gradually that Blackmore-Sahib had
never before realized how different he was in moral
integrity from what he had been in that boyhood
home and how different he must be in reality from
what his mother had imagined that he would be in
her fond dreams about the future. Had India by
her enervating climate, by the ease with which she
gratifies the sensual side of man's nature, and by the
intellectual loneliness in which she makes her foreign
rulers live&mdash;had India by these means warped his
moral sense? Or had his good life in Christian
England been a foolish fanaticism and was his life
here the true living of a free soul?</p>

<p>Blackmore-Sahib was startled at the presence of
such questionings in a mind which heretofore had
accepted his conduct and life unquestioned. But at
that moment there stole upon him the memory of a
sweet white face, drawn with pain and the sound of
a low but earnest voice saying, "My boy, I am
going away&mdash;to leave you alone. Be strong and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>brave and good." These memories as they mingled
in his mind and ears with the picture of a beautiful,
dark face full of suffering into which he had looked
that very morning and the sound of sharp moans
still coming through the half-closed bungalow door,
worked strange havoc within him.</p>

<p>Although his thoughts had carried him far, only a
few moments had actually passed when, hearing
quick steps beyond the compound wall, he came to
a halt and saw an English woman hurry in at the
gate, followed by the panting ayah.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, Mr. Blackmore," spoke a pleasant
English voice. "I am not a physician, but I'll do
the best I can."</p>

<p>Blackmore-Sahib followed clumsily, as a man does
in a house of illness, after the energetic little figure
that went straight to Nona's room. There the missionary
spent much time examining her patient and
it was with anxious eyes that she finally looked at
the man as he sat near the door.</p>

<p>"It is a serious case. I have seen just one like it
before," she said. "But since it is impossible to get a
real physician I will do the best I can. Will you
kindly send me a couple more servants and order
several tubs of hot water got ready? Then, please,
go away for a gallop and do not come back for several
hours. I don't believe you know much about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>sickness and a good ride will brace you up, for you
will have to watch with her to-night, I think." The
last was said with a smile as she started quickly and
quietly about her preparations.</p>

<p>At the end of two hours he met her at the bedroom
door.</p>

<p>"She is more comfortable, but it will be a hard
fight. I shall stay here to-night. I don't dare trust
the case to any one else yet."</p>

<p>In the morning, when at five o'clock he was wakened
from a fitful sleep by a rap at his door, the
same voice said, "She is resting now. Will you
come and watch her while I go home for a short
time? I cannot leave her alone with the servants,
for they are either too tired or too stupid to obey instructions
this morning."</p>

<p>About seven she returned and all day long, sometimes
by turns, sometimes together, they watched
and waited, doing all they could to help Nature
bring back peace to the poor suffering body.</p>

<p>About the middle of the morning he asked her
how she had gained her medical skill. Then she
told him of her life in India and how she had found
that by helping the sick she could most easily reach
the hearts of the people. She told of spending one
furlough in a hospital at home for training. Seeing
that the conversation did not annoy the patient and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>that it seemed to interest the man, she went on telling
about her work and the joys and sorrows that
she had experienced as a missionary. Not one word
of preaching! She simply told of her life as if talking
to an old friend. There was not a sign that she had
recognized anything unusual in this household or
seen anything to condemn. He began to wonder if
she knew and yet he felt that she did know. She
talked about England and the home she had hoped
to go to the next year; but no one had been found
to take her place and she could not go until there
was some one to work for her people. He was surprised
at the light in her eyes when she said: "I'll
not leave them without some one to care for them
even if I have to put off my home-going all my life."</p>

<p>She talked of Christ so freely and of her own religious
beliefs so naturally that he felt that her speech
grew out of her life and he did not resent the personal
religious element in her conversation which he
had always avoided and resented in others.</p>

<p>But while she was talking in low tones or listening
to him as he, in turn, told of his home in England,
she kept a keen eye on her patient. About
eight o'clock at night a change came. The moaning
stopped; the restless brown hands grew still;
the breath came regularly; and Nona slept a quiet,
restful sleep. The memsahib, on her knees beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>the bed, looked up at the big, burly, white man
standing on the other side of the narrow couch.
"She will get well," she said simply. "And now&mdash;now"&mdash;she
stammered with difficulty, "you will
marry her, won't you?"</p>

<p>As the astonished man gazed into her wistful,
earnest face a slow resolve grew in his own. The
coming of this strong, wholesome woman into his
life, the revival of the memories of his boyhood, the
face of his mother, never entirely forgotten, and now
clear and vivid before his very eyes, and, more even
than all these, the dawning consciousness of the Presence
in which his life had been lived and was now
being judged cleared away all his ethical confusion,
revealed to him the evil of his past life and begat in
him a great desire for cleansing and a high purpose
to make amends for the past.</p>

<p>And so when the missionary memsahib said to
him, "You will marry her, won't you?" his astonishment
slowly gave way to a sense of high moral
purpose. After a silence which revealed the struggle
within, he replied in a firm voice, "I will! and
may God bless you."</p>

<p>With these words the man dropped upon his
knees on the other side of the bed and his head
rested for a moment on the pillow very close to the
beautiful brown face there. Then, without asking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>permission, the missionary prayed a simple prayer of
thanksgiving for the life of the woman and a request
for a blessing upon her English brother and herself
that they might shape their lives after the character
of Christ and live according to Christian laws.</p>

<p>Then the missionary slipped quietly out of the
room, for the danger was over and the servants
could take as good care of their mistress as could
she. But she promised the anxious ayah as she
went away that she would come in from time to time
for a few days to see that all went well.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two weeks from that day an Englishman stood
with a Hindu woman by his side in a missionary's
parlour and there a quiet wedding ceremony was performed.
To the bride it meant nothing, but to the
bridegroom it meant an entire change in his life and
heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several years later an English gentleman bore
unflinchingly the embarrassment&mdash;and worse&mdash;of
introducing an Indian wife to his English family at
home. Tenderly he sheltered her from all annoyances
and apparently with pride he took her from
place to place in the homeland. Only one person, a
missionary from India, home on a long-delayed
furlough, guessed that the journey was one prolonged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>torture to the man who, from a high sense of duty
to a woman who could not even comprehend it, was
making her all amends in his power for a wrong
which, also, she did not comprehend.</p>

<p>"I don't understand why he married a native,"
one of the Englishman's relatives remarked to a
friend. "Otherwise he is a perfect Christian gentleman
and an honour to the family."</p>

<p>The missionary, who chanced to overhear the
remark, in her mind erased the "otherwise."</p><hr class="chap" />

Mundra</h2>

<p>"Mundra!" a harsh voice screamed from
the door of the mud house. "Mundra,
child of the devil, come here. Where
are you, spending all your life in laziness and I working
hard to put rice into the mouth of a god-cursed
creature like you!"</p>

<p>There would have been no need for more than the
first call, if the old woman had simply wanted the
child to come to her, for at the first sound of the
voice the little thing had started up from the dirt of
the road where she had been lying and, gathering the
sari, in which she had been wrapped, up around her
hips and waist, had moved hastily towards the
speaker. But the woman seemed to be giving vent
to her own ill nature in an evidently customary and
certainly vivid way.</p>

<p>"You vile object of the gods' wrath! To be
sleeping when every decent creature is at work!</p>

<p>"Bring water," the old woman commanded fiercely
and with a thrust of her foot sent the child, who had
reached the door by that time, reeling in the direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>of a large brass water pot which stood in a corner of
the mud porch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
  <a name="illus09" id="illus09" href="images/illus09.jpg">
    <img src="images/illus09-tb.jpg" width="400" height="281" alt="Woman and girl working at the grinding-stones" />
  </a>
  <br />
  <span class="caption">&quot;FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE MANAGED TO KEEP UP THE STRAINING MOVEMENT&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Evidently too wise and too tired for words, the
little creature, recovering her balance, quietly but
not without great difficulty, lifted the big, brass jar
and, putting it upon her head, started off down the
village street.</p>

<p>The small, dark, thin figure walked very straight
because of the jar on the head, not from any sense
of pride, for what had Mundra to be proud of? Not
a single ornament so dear to the hearts of India's
women did the child wear; her sari was but a dirty
cloth; and her head was shaven. Little girls of her
own age with clinking anklets and glistening jewels
drew away their gay garments from any possible
contact with hers as she came near and stepped to
one side of the street with their water jars. The
men who came towards her along the road carefully
turned away so as to avoid her shadow as she passed
them. And no one addressed her except as a small
boy now and then pointed a finger at her and called
out the same words which the men muttered to
themselves as she passed them&mdash;"Cursed of the
gods."</p>

<p>As she paused to rest for a moment under the
shade of the great peepul tree which protects the
emblems most sacred to the Hindu villager, even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>priest, who tended the various small shrines beneath
the great tree, muttered a curse and moved quickly
to the other side of the gnarled trunk where a coolie,
clad only in soiled white loin cloth and dirty pink
turban, was winding a garland of marigolds about
one of the sacred stones. The worshipper's attention,
attracted by the sudden movement of the priest, was
drawn to Mundra and he in turn, muttering, paused
in his acts of worship until the contaminating
presence should be withdrawn.</p>

<p>When the child reached the well, she had to wait
at a distance until all the others there had filled their
vessels and gone. Then she filled her own and,
without assistance, although it took a dreadful
struggle, raised it to the necessary position on her
head.</p>

<p>But the child was so accustomed to all this treatment
and so tired that she scarcely noticed how the
people acted. Her body ached all over, from hard
work and blows, even to her very heart, which really
ached hardest of all. Just one short year before
Mundra had been one of the happy, bejewelled girls
of this very town and everybody had smiled at her
and passers-by had called her "Blest of the gods."
But now how different! Her father had been of the
weaver caste and when she had been about ten years
old, no native ever knows his exact age, she had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>married to a man in the same caste. And at that
time, less than one year before, she had gone to her
husband's home a welcomed bride, the very home
to which she was now returning in disgrace, and her
mother-in-law had been pleased with her and greeted
her with kind words, the very same woman who but
a few moments before had kicked her away with
curses.</p>

<p>At the time of Mundra's wedding the people had
been anxious because rain had not come and the
crops were dying. Therefore, with grain still at famine
prices from the year before, conditions had been
bad in the district where she lived. So it had not
been a surprise when, soon after the wedding, among
these ill-fed natives had come the ever-expected and
ever-dreaded cholera. In the early days of the
scourge Mundra's father and mother had died. At
first their death had meant little to the child for she
was no longer a part of their household. But soon
death did take one whose going meant at once more
to her, almost more, than the loss of her own life.
One morning her husband, a strong man of about
thirty, was stricken. By nightfall another body had
been placed upon the funeral pyre and Mundra was
a widow.</p>

<p>Mundra, and she alone, had caused the death of
her husband; so thought every one in the village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>and so thought the child herself, brought up in Hinduism.
Now she realized the death of her parents,
for had they been alive she would have been sent
back to them at once. But since they were dead she
had to be kept as a despised member of the household
of her mother-in-law, practically a slave there,
with all the hardships and abuse usually attendant
upon the lot of such an one. Her hair had been cut
off; her pretty jewelry had been taken from her;
her coloured saris had been sold to a neighbour; and
in place of all these belongings she had been given a
few yards of white cotton to wrap about her and part
of a ragged blanket for a bed. But Mundra could
have stood all this hard treatment, hard as it had been,
and even gladly would have slept on the mud porch
with the cattle or in the street with the dogs, if only
every one had not hated her and shunned her as foul
and unclean, if only some one had loved her, if only
some one had even spoken kindly to her sometimes
or smiled upon her.</p>

<p>"Late as usual, you foul creature of the dust! If
you have touched that water with your unclean
hands, may the next drop which you take into your
accursed mouth choke you! To your work there
at once, you abomination in the sight of all that's
holy! May the moon blast you! May the sun
smite you! May your food poison you! And may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>the gods damn you, you devil-bought murderer of
men!"</p>

<p>This was the greeting the child received as she
staggered upon the porch and almost fell as she
set the brass jar in the corner. But not one moment's
rest was there for her.</p>

<p>"To your work, I say!" shrieked the woman
again, pointing a brown, bony finger towards the
grinding-stones in the opposite corner of the porch
where sat a strong young girl, about sixteen years of
age, with her hand already upon the handle of the
stones waiting for Mundra to help her. This girl
was well dressed, an honoured daughter-in-law in the
family, who must do a share of the household work,
as all Indian women, except the rich, must, but who
was well fed, strong, and able to work.</p>

<p>Mundra sank down on the floor beside the mill
and, placing her small hand on the handle above the
other's big one, threw all the strength she could
muster into her thin arm to make the one great stone
revolve upon the other beneath and crush to flour
the grain which by handfuls with her free hand the
older girl was pouring into the opening at the top of
the stone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the mother-in-law had lighted a fire in
the tiny mud stove beside them, the home-made
mud stove, found even in the kitchens of the rich, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>small, hollow, semicircular mound of mud about
eight inches high, upon which a kettle could be set
and within which a fire could be lighted and replenished
through the opening in front. Upon this stove,
instead of a kettle, the woman had put a large, flat,
iron griddle, upon which, after having patted and
rolled out some flour, she threw a flat cake, about
eight inches in diameter. This cake she turned with
a pair of long, iron tongs. After it had browned a
little, she thrust it over the coals in the fire to let it
puff out and when it was just right to suit her Indian
taste, with the iron tongs she tossed it, the hot
chapati, the common bread of India, into a basket
by her side. This process she had repeated until
her basket was nearly full.</p>

<p>The old woman was not so busily engaged with
this task, however, as to be unable to give her attention
to other things. When Mundra's tired hand
relaxed its hold upon the handle of the grinding-stones
and the strength in her little body gave out,
with one swing of the arm, down upon the child's
bare back came the hot tongs.</p>

<p>"To work, you accursed creature!" screamed the
mother-in-law.</p>

<p>A sharp cry of agony followed the blow, but
Mundra, although her body was quivering with pain,
resumed her work. For a few minutes she managed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>to keep up the straining movement of the arm.
Then, in spite of all her gathered will, her fingers
slipped again. Down came the hot tongs a second
time upon the tender, though dark, skin and Mundra
fell in a faint beside the mill.</p>

<p>When the child regained consciousness she was
still lying beside the mill. She could hear the family
within eating their evening meal of chapatis, rice,
and curry. She could hear their talk of the coming
rain, of the tiger that had been seen in the jungle
near the river, of the preparations for the festival of
Ram, and of the offerings of rice and flowers which
must be taken to the god before the day of the great
procession. Dimly she heard it all. No one mentioned
her or seemed to have noticed her lying there
in the corner of the porch. She hoped that they
had not; if they would only forget her and torture
her no more for a little while she would be so glad!</p>

<p>The smell of the fresh chapatis, however, made
her long for food, for as a widow she had had no
meal since morning and could have nothing more
until the next day. The pain in her back almost
made her cry out at times, but she restrained herself
and lay still, unheeded, in the corner behind the
mill, until darkness came and the lump of clay in the
little shrine across the street under the red flag had
been propitiated by offerings of rice and chapatis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>and the people of the household had rolled themselves
in their blankets and gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Then Mundra dragged herself to the edge of the
porch and looked about. All was dark except a
tiny spot in front of the shrine opposite, which was
still lighted by a small wick burning in a shallow
dish of oil. The priest had not yet come for the
offering.</p>

<p>All was quiet.</p>

<p>An old blue rag, the remnants of a sari, lay on the
floor near her. Mundra picked it up quickly. As
quickly and silently she slipped across the street, and&mdash;unholy
act! worthy of one "cursed of the gods"!&mdash;she
emptied the dish of rice which stood there
before the idol into the piece of blue cloth; then
laying the chapatis upon the rice, hurriedly tied the
whole into a bundle. For a moment she stood looking
up and down the street. In both directions all
was still quiet and dark. But she did not hesitate
long. Towards the river, where the jungle lay, the
tiger might be; down towards the well, where the
village street joined the public highroad, there
might be&mdash;the child did not know what, except
that somewhere in that direction lay the great city.</p>

<p>She turned towards the highroad. Creeping
along, half walking, half crawling, she reached the
well. There beside it she tore off her own dirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>white covering, and, having changed the rice from
the blue cloth into a piece of the white, she wrapped
the ragged blue sari around her and drew it up over
her shaven head.</p>

<p>Having, with the shrewdness of the native, placed
her old clothes on the brink of the well, Mundra,
now no longer in the garb of a widow, turned down
the main road towards the great city. She knew
not what might await her there, but, childlike, she
had faith to believe that even unknown people would
not treat a beggar more cruelly than she, a widow,
had been treated by her own.</p><hr class="chap" />

Of the Tribe of Haunamon</h2>

<p>The great bungalow, set far back in the
grassy compound and shaded by mango
trees, looked peaceful and sleepy in the
afternoon sunlight. The very roses in the carefully
rounded beds in the centre of the lawn before the
house were nodding as if resting in the shade after
the blaze of an Indian noonday sun. The only
human creature in sight, a dhersy, sitting cross-legged
on the little side porch, was asleep over his
sewing. Between the rows of potted ferns and
palms along the front veranda appeared glimpses of
white as if the occupants of the bungalow might be
taking their siestas on the open rattan couches in
preference to the warmer curtained beds within, one
of which could be seen through an open bedroom
door. A mongoose, tied to a post of the veranda,
had, for a moment, ceased to fret at his bondage and
gone to sleep. Even several lizards half-way across
the gravel path from one grassy hunting ground to
another had stopped as if too exhausted to pursue
the never-ending chase. Only the shadows moved,
little by little lengthening out, creeping towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>compound wall, as the never-sleeping sun continued
his ceaseless journeying towards the west.</p>

<p>Still one hundred and twenty by the thermometer
which on the wall behind the sleeping dhersy caught
the direct rays of the sun! At three o'clock of an
afternoon in India after a morning's combat with the
heat how could Nature do aught but sleep in whatever
shade she could find for her weary head? But
even in sleepy, dreamy India there are the exceptions
that prove the rules. Suddenly a wail arose
upon the sleepy air and a most terrified cry broke up
all quiet and repose.</p>

<p>The dhersy, startled from his stolen slumber, looking
up guiltily, quickly began to turn the wheel of
the hand-sewing machine beside him. The mongoose
tugged at his cord. And a frightened woman
started up from her couch on the front veranda, as a
little white figure with flying feet and topiless curly
head came running from behind the bungalow with
the usual cry of childhood's terror:</p>

<p>"Mother! Mother! Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>Even the ayah, who was trying to keep up with
the child but having a hard time to run in her long,
tightly-drawn sari, looked frightened. An ugly chattering,
sounding from behind the house, kept up for
some moments as the mother, having gathered the
child up in her arms, sat down again with her, soothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>and quieting her as only a mother can, while the
ayah dropped panting on the floor beside them.</p>

<p>"There, dear, what is the matter? Tell mother
quickly."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! The monkeys! The monkeys!"
sobbed the child.</p>

<p>"There, there, dear, don't cry. You are here
with mother now and the monkeys cannot hurt you.
Tell mother what happened."</p>

<p>However, before the little girl could calm herself
enough to tell the story, the ayah began it for her.</p>

<p>"Baby woke early from her nap to-day, Memsahib,
and would not go to sleep again and so I
dressed her and brought her down for her bread and
milk. She ate it like the good little girl that she is and
so I gave her a piece of cake. I had just turned to
put the plate back in the cupboard, when I heard a
scrambling noise behind me and there was a monkey.
He grabbed the cake from baby's hand and ran up a
tree, chattering. He was a great, big fellow, the
biggest one I ever saw. He looked very fierce and
chattered terribly. Of course baby was frightened
most to death and she ran at once for you." The
ayah looked fearfully over her shoulder. "I'm afraid
to go back there again myself."</p>

<p>"Hush, ayah!" whispered the mother over the
child's head. "Don't frighten her any more. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>you were giving her cake, too, when I have told you
that she must not have any for a few days now as she
really hasn't been feeling very well."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" interrupted the child, who had
got the better of her sobs. "The monkey looked so
ugly and grabbed the cake right out of my hand just
as I was going to take a bite. His paw almost
touched my face. Will he come again?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," replied the mother as she hugged the
little girl close in her arms. "Father comes home
to-night. We will tell him and he will send the
monkeys away. Something has got to be done, for
we cannot have the naughty monkeys stealing our
baby's food right out of her mouth," she added
playfully.</p>

<p>"Look, dear," she said in a moment to the child
whose fright was soon over. "See how your curls
are mussed! And, dearie," she looked at the little
girl very reproachfully, "you ran all the way around
in the sun without your topi. Go into the house
now and let ayah fix your hair and wash your face.
Then you can come out again and we will watch for
father together, for he will surely come soon. Won't
it be nice to have father home again?" And she
kissed the child as she set her down on the floor.
"A week isn't very long, but it seems a month since
he went away this time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span></p><p>"Yes, the naughty monkeys have been so bad!"
nodded the little girl as she hopped along into the
bungalow before her native nurse, forgetful of her
fear, for her father was coming home and he was to
her omnipotent. Nothing, not even a monkey,
could harm her while he was near.</p>

<p>For a moment after the child had gone, the mother
remained standing by one of the veranda pillars,
looking down the road in the direction of the railway
station. But soon she retreated to a chair near the
door, for the branches of the biggest tree near the
porch had begun to sway and she could see distinctly
at least one pair of bright eyes peering out
from among the shining green leaves.</p>

<p>"Something must be done!" she said aloud as
she sank into the chair, at the same time instinctively
taking up in her hand a paper weight which lay on
the table beside her. "We just cannot stand being
thus bothered and frightened by these animals, and
such horrid looking ones too!"</p>

<p>The Burbanks had been in Sindabad only two
weeks and had scarcely got settled in their bungalow
when Mr. Burbanks had been called away on business.
He had felt very secure about leaving his family because
of the location of their new home which was
about half a mile from the native city and very close
to the other few European residences. To him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>bungalow had appeared to be far enough away from
the native quarter to be free from all unpleasant sights,
odours, and visitors, the usual unpleasant associations
of too close proximity to one of the sacred cities of
India. Disagreeable sounds he had expected they
would hear, for the hideous sounds, especially of
night in a Hindu city, carry far. But after a residence
of five years in India he did not think his
family would be particularly annoyed by them.</p>

<p>So Mr. Burbanks had been perfectly satisfied with
his new residence and its location until just before he
left he and his wife had been obliged to drive
through the native city on some errand. It had
been with great disgust that they had seen the filth
of the place, the usual filth of a native city, but here
augmented by a horde of hideous monkeys that,
unrestrained, wandered about the streets, over the
houses, in and out of the windows, apparently the
most respected denizens of this most holy city. To
kill a monkey is a most heinous sin in the eyes of a
Hindu! Did not Haunamon and his monkeys help
the great god Ram and rescue his wife Sita when
she had been carried off by his rival? Besides,
these animals are surely some Hindu's beloved dead.
Therefore no one in Sindabad ever touched or
harmed a monkey. When, however, the creatures
got so thick that life became unendurable, the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>would entice a crowd of them into a great basket
and carry them off to the forest and let them
loose there. But this did not happen often, because
the native of India will put up with well-nigh unendurable
conditions rather than break through
established custom and perform an unusual task.</p>

<p>As they had looked upon the monkey-infested
city, Mrs. Burbanks had wondered aloud if the
animals would venture as far as their bungalow, but
her husband had assured her that they were much
too far from the city and the bazaars for that. But
the sight of the animals had taken off the keen edge
of their satisfaction in their new home and womanlike
Mrs. Burbanks had worried about the matter
until a week had passed without the appearance of
any such company in the compound. Then she had
felt better and both of them had forgotten all about
the monkeys. However, the very next morning
after her husband's departure a strange running and
jumping on the roof had awakened Mrs. Burbanks,
who, peering cautiously from the window of her
roof-bedroom, a room which the most fortunate of
India's foreign residents consider a requisite of their
bungalows for the hot weather, she had seen a couple
of big monkeys sporting across the roof. And from
that moment it had kept up: monkeys here;
monkeys there; monkeys everywhere, poking their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>inquisitive fingers and noses into everything in the
compound except the house itself. Into the house
they had not ventured and even on the verandas the
family had felt secure from intrusion until now;
but now one had actually jumped into the rear
veranda and stolen a piece of cake from Marjory's
hand.</p>

<p>"This is too much! Something must be done!"
said Mrs. Burbanks again aloud but in a more decided
tone, as she saw three of the brown creatures
playing tag across the rose-bed.</p>

<p>Just then the sound of horses' feet upon the road
came to her ears; the monkeys vanished; and Mrs.
Burbanks forgot her annoyance in greeting her
husband as he drove up in a covered gari, shunning
the light even of the setting sun.</p>

<p>Mr. Burbanks looked tired as he superintended the
carrying in of his luggage and the paying of the
gariwala, who, of course, tried to insist upon a larger
fare than the correct one handed him. He seemed
glad to stretch out at once in a big chair and take a
cup of tea from his wife's hand, while he listened
drowsily to her account of the happenings of the
week of separation. Little Marjory came out for her
petting soon and clambered upon the arm of his
chair. Smoothing his hair, she wove admiring
remarks upon her father's appearance and her gladness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>at his return into an account of her recent experience
with the monkey.</p>

<p>"Father dear," she said, turning his head with a
chubby hand on each side of his chin. "Father
dear, I'm so glad you have come home. Now you
must look right at me for I've something very
'portant to tell you. Father, a monkey"&mdash;her eyes
got big and round, "a monkey jumped down from
the tree&mdash;&mdash; Oh, father! What funny eyes you've
got!" and she stopped her story with a little squeal
to look at his eyes which he had made very round in
imitation of her own when she had mentioned the
monkey. Then not satisfied with just looking at
such "funny" eyes, Marjory pulled them up at the
corners to see how they would look that way. After
a moment's critical survey, she shook her head and
went on with her story. "The monkey jumped
down from a tree. Ayah had just given me a piece
of cake and&mdash;&mdash; Why, father, what a pretty
necktie you've got! I never saw that one before."
With pats and pulls she spent some time endeavouring
to arrange the "pretty necktie" before going on
with her story. "And"&mdash;she began again with a
lingering look at her last twist at the tie, "that
monkey jumped down from the tree right at me and
grabbed my cake and ran away."</p>

<p>She paused again and inspected her sleepy looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>father. "I b'lieve," she said as her eye ran slowly
up and down her father's white-clad figure, "I b'lieve
I'd like monkeys better if they wore white. Do
monkeys ride on railway trains? Did they keep you
awake last night as they did mother? You look so
sleepy, father dear, that I am sure they did."</p>

<p>Mr. Burbanks, somewhat awakened by the incongruous
remarks of his daughter, laughed and said,
"I've never met a monkey on a railway train yet.
But weren't you afraid of the one you saw?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I cried and ran to mother but I'm not
afraid any more now for mother said you wouldn't
let them hurt me." And Marjory cuddled down in
his arms.</p>

<p>"See, there is one in that tree there now and I'm
not afraid," she said after a moment and, raising her
head from his arm, pointed towards a tree a little to
the right, where was a large monkey jumping from
bough to bough with a tiny baby monkey clinging
fearlessly beneath her.</p>

<p>The father and the little girl watched the monkey
and her baby with great interest until the ayah came
and took Marjory in to bed.</p>

<p>Throughout dinner and the evening Mrs. Burbanks
told of their troubles with the monkeys during
her husband's absence and urged him to do
something to drive them away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span></p><p>But at the close of the evening all the satisfaction
she received was this very masculine reply to all of her
urgings: "You are simply nervous over them. I
don't believe they will do any harm. In fact they
seem to me to be rather interesting creatures. That
one out there on the lawn this afternoon appeared
perfectly harmless and playful. Besides they are
sacred animals and we might make the Hindus very
angry if we should touch them." And with a yawn
Mr. Burbanks started for bed.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Burbanks saw that all of her conversation
had not impressed her husband with the urgency
of the situation, unusual woman that she was,
she said no more, but wisely left the matter to time.
Even when they were awakened at an early hour the
next morning, she did not say a word, but listened
with relish to the remarks which issued from the curtained
bed beside her own.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Burbanks' departure his wife had paid
no attention to his office, as her servants could be
trusted to keep things clean and in order. Therefore,
when he came to her a little later in the morning
with complaints about the condition of his desk,
she was extremely annoyed. His inkstand had been
tipped over; his blotting-pad was torn; his pens
were lying scattered about the room; and the books
on the table were all in confusion. The servants declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>that all had been in perfect order the night
before. The ayah said that Marjory had not
entered the room. So Mrs. Burbanks, after inspecting
the strange confusion, was about to leave the
room in perplexity when she chanced to glance at
one of the high windows. Quickly, with a smile
upon her lips and a twinkle in her eye, she motioned
to her husband to come from the veranda
where he had retired after finding the disorder in his
study. His eyes followed hers to the window and
there he saw a monkey watching them intently from
the small window sill.</p>

<p>"Don't stare at him or he may spring at you,"
cautioned Mrs. Burbanks. "Monkeys are just the
opposite to most animals. You cannot treat one or
control him in the same way, for it angers him to
have you look him in the eye. The servants all tell
me that."</p>

<p>As they turned away, the bearer entered the
room. To his wife's amusement, Mr. Burbanks addressed
him fretfully. "Boy, can't you drive these
monkeys away? They are beginning to be a nuisance."</p>

<p>"Me touch a monkey!" The usually obedient
boy raised his hands in horror.</p>

<p>During the dialogue the monkey had scuttled
away. So the high window was closed by the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>bamboo pole, for&mdash;"The monkeys must be kept
out even if the ventilation is interfered with," said
the head of the house.</p>

<p>After breakfast the post brought a package of
home letters and, although it was the middle of the
morning, Mr. Burbanks took a while off, after his
week of strenuous work, to listen to home news. He
laid himself in a comfortable chair preparatory to listening
to his wife's reading, for he always preferred
to hear her comments and exclamations as she read
aloud than to read the letters himself. Mrs. Burbanks
seated herself at the table beside him and, although
a young woman, put out her hand to take
up the reading glasses which invariably lay by her
sewing basket.</p>

<p>"Why, my glasses aren't here!" she exclaimed
in a tone of annoyance.</p>

<p>A search followed but no glasses could be found.
After a while, in despair, Mrs. Burbanks handed the
letters to her husband and prepared to be herself the
listener, a situation which neither really enjoyed.
But scarcely had Mr. Burbanks reached the
second page of the first letter when an exclamation
of surprise from his wife stopped the reading
and he found her looking with laughing eyes
at a spot high up on the wall. There, hanging
by the bows from the moulding, were the spectacles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>With one voice the two exclaimed: "A
monkey!"</p>

<p>The boy was called and the spectacles were soon
rescued from the dangerous place where they had
evidently been hung with great care, for they were
uninjured.</p>

<p>Although this was but a trifling incident, Mr.
Burbanks was disturbed by the impertinence of the
"ugly beasts." But his wife made no comments on
the encounters of the morning, going on with her
work in silence, although she had to hang her head
to hide her smiling lips at some of his muttered remarks
when he returned from an attempt to clear up
the papers on his office desk. One valuable document
was badly blotted with ink and a letter of the
greatest importance he had been able to read only
after patching together the torn bits gathered from
the rug.</p>

<p>Mr. Burbanks was plainly annoyed but his annoyance
grew to fear in the early afternoon when, in
passing by the dining-room door, he happened to
look in. Marjory had slipped into her mother's chair
and with a big napkin around her neck was about to
eat a luscious guava which lay on the plate before
her. Mr. Burbanks was just on the point of calling
out something in play to his little daughter, when a
quick motion on the wall behind her attracted his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>attention. Afraid to move or speak for fear of bringing
greater danger to the child, the father watched in
silence. An immense monkey slid down the wall
and jumped into the chair beside the little girl, with
his eye on the fruit before her. The child,
frightened, shooed with her handkerchief at the beast,
who, turning his eyes upon her, showed his teeth
and snarled. The man held his breath; but the
child, shoving the plate of fruit towards the animal
quickly slipped from her chair and ran, unharmed,
out of the room. In a second the monkey had
seized the guava and was gone through the high
window.</p>

<p>That was the last straw. No one could live in
such danger! Mr. Burbanks went back to his study
and called the boy, but he did not tell his wife what
he had seen.</p>

<p>"Can you drive the monkeys away?" he asked
the boy again.</p>

<p>"Me no touch monkeys. Me afraid. Monkeys
belong gods," was the reply he received.</p>

<p>The gentleman could see that no help was to be
had from his servants and he realized that he himself
must move cautiously or he might bring the wrath of
the Hindu city upon him. Therefore he thought
the matter over carefully and decided that first of all
after it had become dark he would fire off his pistol
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>and perhaps frighten the monkeys away without
harming them. So, as soon as night had come and
all were in bed, he told his wife what he intended to
do. She was overjoyed at his quick conversion to
her views, for she did not know even then of
Marjory's experience, as the child, soon forgetting
it in her play, had not mentioned it to her mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Burbanks stepped out upon the roof and after
a moment's pause fired his pistol into a clump of
trees at a little distance from the bungalow. A
sharp, shrill, almost human cry came from the tree
and then all was still. Even the chokidar, already
asleep, did not seem to have heard the shot.</p>

<p>"Well, I've killed one, I guess," Mr. Burbanks said
as he came back into the room. "That is too bad!
I hope the natives won't mind. But it is over now
and we need not worry. If they do make a fuss we
will just have to face the music, that's all. Probably
it will drive the animals away effectually, if one of
them is killed. I most sincerely hope so."</p>

<p>There was quiet throughout the night, although
Mrs. Burbanks lay awake listening for trouble as
women will. But in the early morning, just as she
had at last fallen into a light sleep, they were both
awakened by the usual noise of running and jumping
on the roof. With an exclamation of great annoyance
Mr. Burbanks sprang up and opened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>shutters of the door. He stood there in silence for a
minute before he spoke again and then he called his
wife softly to come and look out. There, on the
roof, stood a female monkey and before her lay a
tiny, baby monkey, dead, with a hole in its breast.
The mother patted it with her paw; she stroked it;
then she ran around it and jumped up and down as
if to attract its attention. Then she took it up and
put its arms about her and started to spring away,
evidently expecting it to cling beneath her as it had
always done; but the little thing fell limply back
upon the roof. Again and again the mother tried,
with the infinite patience of a mother. But finally,
with a cry of despair, she picked the baby up in her
arms and, squatting down, rocked to and fro, moaning
and moaning. The servant, bringing up the
chota hazri, made a noise at the foot of the stairs.
The monkey, with an almost human look of woe,
glanced around at the sound and the Burbanks,
watching from the shuttered door, saw the agonized
expression on her face, as she sprang to her feet and
with the dead baby still clasped tightly in her arms
leaped away among the tree tops.</p>

<p>With tears in her eyes Mrs. Burbanks turned to
her husband. "You won't shoot another, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, we'll move before I use the gun
again. But it seemed to be a choice between her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>baby and mine and, of course, I am glad that it was
hers," Mr. Burbanks replied. Then he told his wife
of Marjory's experience.</p>

<p>But the Burbanks did not have to move, for the
monkeys disappeared. Since her parents never told
Marjory why they had gone, she watched for them
for a long time and ate her cakes in haste lest "a
naughty monkey might snatch 'em."</p>

<p>One day a short time after their disappearance
Marjory received a present from her father of a little
black dog. When she playfully asked him why he
had bought her the dog, expecting that he would
say because she had been such a good girl, he said,
"Because monkeys are afraid of dogs."</p>

<p>"Why, how funny!" she exclaimed. "You
bought me a mongoose because snakes are afraid of
mongooses and now I have a dog because monkeys
are afraid of dogs. What pet will you buy me next,
father dear?"</p>

<p>"I will have to live in India a little longer before
I can answer that question, my daughter." And,
wondering what unexpected danger would next
assail his child in this strange land, he swung her up
on his shoulder and, as it was sunset, carried her
tenderly into the house to her waiting ayah, followed
by the dog&mdash;a tiny, but sufficient guard against the
encroachments of the tribe of Haunamon.</p><hr class="chap" />

In Ways Mysterious</h2>

<h3><abbr title="1">I</abbr></h3>

<p>The bare audience room of old Boyle
Avenue Church was almost empty; only a
few of those who had been present at the
afternoon service still lingered, one little knot by the
door, another near the altar rail. This is not the
church where the real Europeans meet to worship
God, you know, nor is it even one of the worshipping
places of the semi-European population of
Bombay. It is the oldest building of our mission
property and belongs to our native church. It is,
therefore, all the church home to-day that three
separate congregations can boast, our Marathi,
Gujarati, and Hindustani congregations.</p>

<p>It is a big, barn-like building situated in a thickly
populated part of the city which, just now, is largely
occupied by Parsis. But although it is old and bare
and far away from most of our native converts, they
travel the long distances from their various quarters
and attend its services faithfully.</p>

  <span class="caption">&quot;I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL WIFE, AS FAIR AS YOUR OWN, SAHIB&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>I tell you my heart glowed that afternoon as I sat
upon the platform and saw that room filled to overflowing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>Not only were the wooden benches
crowded, but people sat in the aisles and stood
around the walls. Our Sunday afternoon congregation
is usually just the Marathis only, and does not
occupy more than a third of the room, but this day
it was a union service of all our people to be conducted
in two languages only, as the Marathi and
Hindustani languages are near enough alike to be
intelligible to both. And why was this great meeting
held? That was what thrilled me I suppose and
broke me all up so that when it came my turn to
speak, I really just couldn't and stood there like a
big baby and cried. But the folk were kind to me
and joined me in my tears and when all I could
falter was, "Good-bye, God bless you all!" they just
fell upon their knees and such prayers went up for
my speedy restoration to health and return to India
that by the time we rose from our knees I felt better
already.</p>

<p>They did not ask me to say anything more from
the platform, but at the close of the service men,
women, and children gathered about me for a last
personal word. You see my health had failed because
of the climate of Northwest India and because
of the burdens that each of our missionaries
has to bear (this isn't complaint, but just fact) and so
I had been ordered home. That part wasn't bad, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>the prospects of seeing home again, that meant
America, looked pretty good to me! Think of seeing
a snow-bank after the one hundred and twenty
degrees in the shade in which I had scorched for
years! Think of drinking cool, unboiled water right
from the tap, and all you wanted of it! Think of
being able to eat fresh, uncooked vegetables without
fear of cholera! Think of being able to do all those
things which are so delectable at home but so foolhardy
in India! The going home part was all right
but the part that wasn't all right&mdash;&mdash; It's hard to
talk about that part. The doctors said that I probably
could never go back to India! Never go back
to India again! Never go back to the people and
work I loved! I tell you it took all the manhood I
had to meet that blow with a smiling face and turn
the other cheek.</p>

<p>But I started to tell you, not about myself at all,
but about Shama Bhana. As I sat on the platform
that afternoon I singled out his face among those of
the men standing by the windows at the right
nearest the altar. Shama Bhana is a Brahmin and
when I have said that I have told you that he is a
man of proud, distinguished appearance and with an
intellectual capacity of the highest order that India
boasts. I have neglected to say that Shama Bhana
is a rich Brahmin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p><p>I had known this man for several years and we
were good friends. I had talked religion with him
by the hour and I felt that he believed in Christ and
in our faith. But I had never been able to bring
him one inch, as it seemed to me, towards forsaking
his old faith and accepting ours publicly. As I saw
his face there that afternoon and knew that he had
come to say good-bye to me, perhaps forever, I
longed to hear him confess Christ before I left India.
I longed to know that he had thrown his wonderful
powers upon the side of our warfare in that country
where his influence would be so great.</p>

<p>The meeting came to an end at last and the crowd
that had gathered to say good-bye to the sahib and
to wish him "Godspeed" had done so and were gone
to their homes, all but two little companies of people
still gathered in the church, as I have said before.</p>

<p>In all my farewells I kept my eye on Shama
Bhana and I noticed that he was still in the little
group by the door. Finally I managed to separate
myself from the company near the altar rail and
started towards the door. Shama Bhana did not
come to meet me but I saw him step a little aside
from the others as if giving me a chance to speak to
him privately. I availed myself of the opportunity
at once.</p>

<p>I went directly to him, holding out my hand, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>Brahmin though he was, he took it, his eyes full of
tears.</p>

<p>"Sahib, it breaks our hearts to have you go," he
said simply.</p>

<p>"Shama Bhana," I replied, "it breaks my heart to
go without having heard you confess the name of
Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour."</p>

<p>He looked at me without a start or quiver just as
if he had been expecting me to say that very thing.
"Shama Bhana," I went on, looking straight into his
face and into his eyes, which steadily returned my
look, "Shama Bhana, you do believe in Jesus Christ,
do you not?"</p>

<p>"Sahib, no longer will I refuse to answer that
question to you, since you are going away from us,
perhaps forever. Sahib, I believe in Jesus Christ.
There is nothing in Hinduism or Brahminism that
can compare with His life and character. There is
nothing that can compare with His teachings. I believe
in God, the Father, and in Jesus Christ, the
Son; and I love them, as you, Sahib, have taught
me to do."</p>

<p>My heart swelled with joy and gratitude.</p>

<p>"Then will you confess your faith and your
love?" I asked him, hoping that I might see him
baptized before I sailed for I coveted him for the
work in Bombay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span></p><p>His face clouded. "That, Sahib, I cannot do. I
have confessed to you, knowing that you will not
tell what I have told you here in India. But I cannot
acknowledge my faith to any one else."</p>

<p>Could it be that I had put too great confidence in
this man's courage and strength? I was disappointed
but I could scarcely credit my own disappointment
and I probed deeper.</p>

<p>"Is it that you fear to lose your material possessions,
Shama Bhana, that you fail to claim the spiritual
ones?" I asked him.</p>

<p>He drew himself up and looked at me in righteous
scorn. "Yes, if I should confess my belief in Christ,
I would lose my wealth, and it is great; but what
would I care for that! I am young. I am strong.
I could earn my way and my family would not starve.
No, Sahib, it is not the fear of the loss of money that
hinders me." But as he saw the troubled look upon
my face, he added, "I will tell all, Sahib, and then
you yourself shall judge if I could act otherwise.</p>

<p>"Sahib, I have a mother. You have never seen
her for you cannot enter our homes as your wives
can, but the memsahib has met her. That mother
knows that I have talked long and earnestly with
you. She knows that I have read much of the doctrine.
She knows, too, that I no longer make offerings
to the idols, and she fears that my heart inclines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>to this new creed. Sahib, my mother a short time
ago took me out into our courtyard and pointed to
the well that is in the middle of the square. She
said to me, 'Shama Bhana, my son, the day you become
a Christian, that day I will throw myself down
that well.' And, Sahib, she would do it!"</p>

<p>And I knew that she would. I could say nothing.
I could only look at him with love and sympathy in
my heart.</p>

<p>"And, Sahib, that is not all," he continued. "I
have a beautiful wife and a son, as fair as your own,
Sahib. I love my wife. I love my son. But,
Sahib, the day I confess Christ publicly these two,
whom I love more than life, will be taken from me
and I shall never see them again.</p>

<p>"Sahib, would Jesus Christ wish me to cause the
suicide of my mother and the separation from me
forever of my wife and child? It is these two things
and these only that keep me from public confession
and baptism."</p>

<p>I could answer nothing. I could only hold his hand
and say, "Pray, Shama Bhana; Christ alone can tell
you your duty. And He will make it plain to you,
if you leave it all to Him. I will pray for you too
as long as I live or, if it may please God to permit it,
until I see you again here in Bombay."</p>

<p>With the hand-clasp of brothers we parted: he, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>Christian in heart but a Brahmin by profession, went
home to his wife and boy and the old mother, strong
in her faith; and I came to the homeland. I haven't
told you his real name nor can I and keep faith with
him, for, although Bombay is thousands of miles away,
words when once spoken may travel far. But I have
told you a true story. May I add a happy conclusion
to at least one part of the theme? I am going back
to India! Thank God! My health has been restored.
When I reach Bombay shall I find Shama Bhana still
a Brahmin or a confessed follower of Christ? That is
the question that is on my heart.</p>

<h3><abbr title="2">II</abbr></h3>

<p>Well, well, well! To think that I should actually
have you with me here in Bombay! Why, I can
hardly believe it is real! Don't I look well and
strong? That doctor at home almost worked miracles
for me with his medicines. My, but it's good
to be back in the harness again! The pull has to be
long and steady and sometimes the straps rub or the
collar galls or the load drags heavily, but it's great
work. I am keeping well, too, and I'm happier than
three years ago I thought I would ever be again in
this world.</p>

<p>What, man, you've only one day to give me in
Bombay? And then you've got to race on or that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>business venture will fall through! Oh, these globe-encircling
Americans who try to see the world and
its sight as do birds on the wing! Why, this is only
an aggravation, Dick! I'd almost rather you
wouldn't have come at all than to give me just one day.</p>

<p>No, you aren't going back either! You know
that I didn't really mean what I said, for just the
sight of your face has done me a world of good already
and before the day is over I will show you
some sights which I dare say will do your heart
good. But in the meantime, I warn you, I shall
talk every minute of the time to make up for all the
days that I can't have you.</p>

<p>Let me see&mdash;we'll go first to visit our day-schools
and call upon our preachers; then we'll drop into
Boyle Avenue Church for a prayer-meeting; then we'll
go to see Shama Bhana; and this evening I'll take you
to a street service. It all sounds prosaic, perhaps,
because I've used hackneyed American terms, but
for a man who has been but one day in India there
won't be anything prosaic about it.</p>

<p>Do you remember, Dick, what I told you men
back home last year about Shama Bhana, the man
we're going to see this afternoon?</p>

<p>It will be quite a long story to tell you how it
came out but I will, for we've got quite a little car
ride ahead of us to reach Parel where we are going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>first to see such a school as you never laid eyes on
before, half-naked children in a palm-leaf hut. But
let me tell you, those children know more Scripture
than your boy and girl do, I am sure.</p>

<p>Well, about Shama Bhana. You know I told you
that before I left for home he had confessed to me
privately that he believed in Christ but he could not
be baptized because his mother threatened to commit
suicide on the day he should become a Christian and
because on that same day his wife and child would
be taken from him forever. All I could do was to
tell him to continue in prayer and that God would
lead him.</p>

<p>About six months after I had left Bombay, very
suddenly Shama Bhana's mother died. That very
day, before the funeral rites had been performed,
Shama Bhana appeared at Deal's door and asked for
baptism. Of course Deal did not know much about
the case, as his work is largely with the Marathis; so
he had to go all over the situation with the Brahmin
and make proof of his belief and sincerity.</p>

<p>His belief seemed genuine and when it came to a
proof of his sincerity, Shama Bhana told his story.
"Now my mother is dead," he concluded. "I could
not come before, for it would have been murder and
that is forbidden in the Bible. She died but an hour
ago and I came at once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span></p><p>"Will you lose your property now?" asked Deal.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I will not have an anna above what
I now carry in my purse. But that is no hardship."</p>

<p>"Will they turn you out of the household at
once?" Deal went on, needlessly probing deeper into
the fresh wounds in the man's heart, but poor Deal
did not seem to understand.</p>

<p>"That is practically done already, Sahib," the
Brahmin answered. "As soon as I heard that my
mother was dead this morning, I kissed my wife
and baby good-bye while they still slept and came
to you, for I know that when I return they will be
withheld from my sight and I shall never see them
more." Shama Bhana was overcome for a moment,
Deal said, and then he went on quietly. "Christ
says that whoever will not leave wife and child for
His sake is not worthy of Him. I could not bring
them with me for you know the way the Hindu oftentimes
takes vengeance; for a few days all would have
gone well; then suddenly they would have sickened
and died a mysterious death. Sahib, I love them too
well to bring death to them and so I left them. Indeed,
I have left all for Christ, Sahib. Will you not
baptize me?"</p>

<p>Deal baptized him at once and then asked what he
could do to help him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span></p><p>Shama Bhana replied, "Nothing, thank you
kindly, Sahib. I will find work at once. I will not
starve. Yes, Sahib, there is something you can do
for me. Pray! Pray that some day I may get my
wife and child back again."</p>

<p>Then Shama Bhana went away. He was a rich
man, the son of great possessions, as I have told you.
The news of his baptism spread fast and the fury of
his father was unrestrained. Shama Bhana was declared
to be dead and his effigy was burned with his
mother's body on the funeral pyre. His wife was
proclaimed a widow and treated as such; her head
was shaved and her jewels and beautiful garments
were taken from her.</p>

<p>But Shama Bhana's Brahmin training stood him
in good stead, for he went on his way apparently
unmoved by all the indignities that were being
heaped upon him and his. He is a remarkably
bright man and so without much difficulty, for he
procured it the very day of his baptism, he got a fair
position as clerk in a big English office in the city.
His family later did everything they could to get
him ousted, by fair means and foul, but he had
proved his worth before they began their work against
him and so he was kept.</p>

<p>That was the situation I found when I returned
from America. At my request Shama Bhana came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>to live with me, but we saw little of each other, for
every moment when he was not in the office he was
out preaching or teaching and with power. But in
the brief intervals that I did see him I knew that his
heart was sore. I had left my own family in
America, you know, and he would look at their picture
upon my dresser. "Your wife is a Christian," he
would say. "And you will probably see them again
in a couple of years. But my wife is a Hindu
widow!" Then he would turn at once into his own
room and I knew he had gone to his knees in prayer.
I would pray, too, both for him and his and for my
own. Though his case was, of course, immeasurably
harder than mine, still I thought I was pretty badly
off with thousands of miles of ocean rolling between
my family and me and with no definite knowledge as
to when we would see each other again, for the kiddies
must be educated, you know.</p>

<p>Well, what if I am blowing my nose violently!
Man, they aren't here yet and what's more, they
aren't coming for another year.</p>

<p>Well,&mdash;then came the pestilence; not the plague
or the cholera or any of those Asiatic diseases which
you folk over there hear so much about and really
know so little of; but the plain smallpox with which
you are at least so familiar that you run away as soon
as you hear the word pronounced. The smallpox is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>usually with us here, more or less, all the time; but
somehow this season it was here in tenfold fury. It
swept over the city, but was worst in the section where
Shama Bhana's family lived. Several of our native
church workers had tried in vain to get entrance into
his house since the trouble had happened, but now
they walked right in and took possession unhindered,
for the father himself and every member of the family
were down with the disease and the servants had all
fled. Shama Bhana's wife, whom they found in a
dark chamber in the servants' quarters, had the worst
form of the disease because of the hunger and ill
treatment she had suffered since she had become a
mock-widow. Shama Bhana who had given up his
place at the office as soon as he heard of the situation
came at once to his wife's side, for there was no one
to object. And as day after day our faithful Hindustani
preacher and his wife worked over that household,
they preached Christ as they worked whenever
a mind was free enough from pain to receive the
message.</p>

<p>Three of the sons died, but the rest of the family
soon began to show signs of recovery. The old
father, since his case had been the lightest, as he had
been vaccinated once years before in an English hospital,
recovered first. As he, in his weakness, lay
and watched the loving ministrations of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>Christians and listened to their words, his heart
seemed to be touched.</p>

<p>"Why do you do all this for me?" he asked one
day. "Are you immune?"</p>

<p>The preacher's wife stood nearest him and she replied,
"I have had the disease but my husband never
has. We are doing it for Christ's sake, you know."</p>

<p>Later he called the preacher to him. "Where is
Shama Bhana?" he whispered. "Has he had it
yet?"</p>

<p>The preacher replied, "He is here just now with
his wife who is very ill. The night that you
were the worst he spent at your side. He has not
had the awful disease yet. Shall I call him to
you?"</p>

<p>The preacher wondered how his words would be
received and feared that a violent rage would bring
back the old man's fever. But he only smiled faintly
and to the question shook his head and said, "It is
the wrath of Shama Bhana's God."</p>

<p>He steadfastly refused to see his son and yet he
did not seem to be angry nor did he order him from
the home. In a few days when his strength had returned
nearly in full measure, he called the preacher
to him again and asked him to walk with him
through the house. So, leaning on the patient
preacher's arm, he went from room to room. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>every room with his feeble hands he tore down every
sign of Hinduism. The gods he took himself from
their shelves and ordered them to be thrown into the
well. When all the rooms except the servants' quarters
had been thus cleared he turned to the amazed
pastor and said:</p>

<p>"Now call my son Shama Bhana and let me be
baptized in his presence, for now I believe as he has
taught me and from now on we will stand as Christians
together and our household shall be a Christian
household."</p>

<p>But when the preacher went to summon Shama
Bhana and to tell him the good news, he found that
young man on the floor beside his wife's cot burning
with a high fever and showing every symptom of the
dread disease. So the baptismal service was postponed
while they worked to save Shama Bhana's
life. Two days later the pastor himself came down.
But as soon as I learned that the old man had been
converted I went at once to Shama Bhana. Before
very long we had there a household of well people,
and such a happy household! Words cannot describe
it.</p>

<p>And so together since that time Shama Bhana, his
father, and not of less importance, his wife, have faced
the Hinduism of Bombay in a small but solid phalanx
for Christ. The influence of the conversion of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>rich, strong Brahmin family has been marvellous, as
you can imagine, and is increasing every day.</p>

<p>We will go there this afternoon and see them all.
Even Shama Bhana's wife will greet you, for there is
no purdah in that home now and she will meet you
as modestly, graciously, and courteously as any lady
in America. God's ways are wonderful, aren't they?
But the most wonderful thing about it all in my mind
is that He always lets us poor, insignificant men help
in bringing His ways to pass. Had our simple, faithful
Hindustani pastor and his wife not been willing to
risk their lives for their love for Christ, probably
Shama Bhana's father would still be a Brahmin, his
wife, most likely, dead, and Shama Bhana himself
still an outcast.</p>

<p>These are the romances of our work and they
serve to throw out against the dark background of
Hindustani life and social customs the capacity of
our Hindu cousins for an appreciative interpretation
of the Oriental Christ and their willingness to share
His life of heroic sacrifice on behalf of others. The
humblest of them frequently rises to acts of great
courage and chivalry.</p>

<p>Well, here we are! You didn't just expect to see
grass huts under palm trees as a suburb of the great
city of Bombay, did you? And there are the
children gathered around the door of the schoolhouse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>waiting for us. Aren't they beauties? Hadn't you
better take a picture of them to show to your boy at

The Way to Happiness</h2>

<p>With a shrill whistle and a clanging of her
engine bell, the train for Calcutta pulled
into the station at M&mdash;&mdash;. "Coolie,
coolie!" with a decided accent on the second syllable,
came the well-known call as scantily-clothed men,
falling in beside the train, ran from the end of the
platform to the station entrance, with hands upon the
first and second-class carriage doors, lest other coolies
might get the jobs of carrying the heavy trunks and
earn the anna or two anna bits that they might have
had.</p>

<p>With a cloth about the loins for decency's sake
and a turban on the head as a pad for heavy boxes,
otherwise naked, the brown coolie took possession of
the upper class compartments and in a minute or so
scores of them were filing away through the station
with heads laden with trunks, boxes, hat-boxes, rolls
of bedding, lunch-baskets, baskets of fruit, and every
conceivable sort of parcel that an Anglo-Indian or a
tourist carries with him in the compartment of an
Indian train; for, although luggage vans are run on
these trains, the charge for excess luggage is so great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>that people crowd as much under the seats, on the
seats, and over the seats as possible. As an individual
rarely travels with less than ten parcels the
platform swarmed with carriers.</p>

<p>While the first and second class passengers in topis
and linen suits were thus being taken out of their
carriages and a fresh lot, also in topis and linen, were
being put in, in no undue haste, for all Indian trains
stop fifteen minutes everywhere; while that end of the
platform, therefore, was in comparative calm, the
other end where the third-class carriages stood was
in an uproar.</p>

<p>Railroad travel is cheaper nowhere in the world
than in India. The traveller can ride in a compartment
for twelve persons by day, six by night, on
leather cushions, with toilet conveniences including
even a shower bath at close hand, for the matter of
one cent a mile; or he can pay about two cents a
mile and ride on cushions a little softer, with a trifle
more floor space for stacking his bird-cages and bandboxes
and with furnishings a little glossier&mdash;first
class; or he can have a ride for almost nothing, if
he will be content to herd with the natives in a coach
with wooden seats, a coach that accommodates from
twenty to fifty, the number depending on the
packing.</p>

<p>Since the fare is so small and since the Hindu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>religion, as also the Mohammedan, teaches the
efficacy of pilgrimages, the people now make their
pilgrimages, as far as possible and wherever possible,
by train. Their religions have thus so accustomed
the natives to the trains that they seem to be always
travelling. The richer ones may go first or second
class. But the majority of them go third and, since
the first person in gets the best seat in these third-class
cars while others crowd in as long as there is an
inch to spare, there is a mad scramble for first,
second, third, fourth, and fifth place at the third-class
carriage doors.</p>

<p>So it was as the Calcutta train pulled into M&mdash;&mdash;.
Men with bundles and women with babies, more
bundles, water jars, and bags of food swarmed into
the third-class coaches. In a remarkably short time,
however, the people who had wanted to get off were
gone with their bundles, trailing women, and dangling
children, and the lot going towards Calcutta
had stowed away inside the carriages, on top of each
other or anywhere that they could, their bundles,
their clinging women, and their crying children;
and still there were several minutes before time for
the train to pull out. Then the through passengers,
since, as the newcomers were settled, their own seats
were secure, could get out upon the platform. A
bearded Mohammedan with flowing robes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>turbaned head, spreading a mat on the platform beside
the car and slipping out of his shoes, knelt
three times and said his prayers towards Mecca, unmindful
of the crowd around him. At the hydrant
a good Hindu carefully washed out his mouth
preparatory to partaking of his noonday meal; while
men of all castes walked up and down beside the
cars, resting their cramped limbs. From the car
windows many a braceleted arm reached out a brass
water jar to be filled by the Mohammedan water-carrier.
And at other windows Hindu women
waited for the Hindu water-carrier to fill their jars so
that they might have water for the journey.</p>

<p>The sweetmeat venders were unusually busy, for
it was just about noon and Indian sweets are to
native Indians really a staple article of diet instead of
a confection as in other countries. They are made
of wholesome food stuffs; sometimes they are
shaped like pretzels; sometimes, rolled into balls;
sometimes, chopped into flakes. But all kinds are
well liked and the boy, passing along the trainside
with the flat basket of sweets upon his head, just in
range of the carriage windows, was kept busy dealing
out his wares until he had a light load left and a
hand full of coppers. The baskets of the pretty
green pan were also many packages lighter when
the gong on the platform sounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span></p><p>At the sound of the gong the through passengers
scrambled back into their places; all but the Mohammedan
faithful, who, having deliberately slipped
his feet back into his shoes, carefully folded up his
prayer mat, and with no loss of dignity climbed
slowly into his compartment.</p>

<p>The guard raised his hand.</p>

<p>The train started.</p>

<p>But in the ladies' compartment of the third class
the confusion continued after the start, for three
naked babies were climbing over their mothers and
crying; an old woman was rummaging over her
treasures which had been tied up in a white cloth
and raising a wild lamentation because she had lost
an anna; and two young beauties in gay saris, with
jangling bracelets, clanking anklets, and flashing
necklaces, were chewing pan very vigorously and
chattering in shrill voices, displaying as they did so
mouths most beautifully reddened with the pan juice
and teeth most artistically blackened by the same
delicacy.</p>

<p>But after a short time the babies, either satisfied
with their natural diet or at least appeased with cold
chapatis or bits of sweets handed out by tired
mothers, became quiet. The old woman, exhausted
by her unavailing search and grief, was reduced to a
quiet mumbling and a hopeless picking at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>bundle. And the two young women became less
noisy in a close comparing of jewels. There was
enough of calm, therefore, so that the travellers
could get a glimpse of each other and see what sort
of company each was in.</p>

<p>It was a motley crowd and one that broke many
of the laws of caste. It showed plainly how much
the railroad is doing to rid India of that curse. In
one corner sat a Brahmin woman, distinguishable by
the refined features of her class rather than the caste
mark upon her forehead, but too poor for the greater
privacy of a second compartment. Next to her, a
proximity which would have broken her caste at one
time, sat a Chumar woman. Next was a lady with
the white head-cloth and one-coloured sari of the
Parsi. And beside the Parsi was a tiny high caste
girl, most bejewelled and bedecked, wearing the
necklace which showed that although she was but
eight or nine years old she was married. Evidently
the child-wife was taking the journey with her
mother-in-law, for the woman next beyond her,
apparently of the same caste, would occasionally jerk
the little girl into her seat and scold her roundly
when she ventured to lean over to look out of the
window.</p>

<p>When the train approached a way-station, the
blinds were drawn quickly lest a man should look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>upon the women within, for, although none of them
were keeping purdah strictly, still most of these
women were careful in public not to subject themselves
unduly to the glances of men.</p>

<p>As the blinds were lifted after the train left the first
small station, the light disclosed, huddled into a far
corner seat, a young woman wrapped in the coarsest of
white garments, with scarcely an ornament upon her
body and no caste mark upon her forehead. Her
face was shaded by the sari which she had drawn
close over her head, but out of the shadow peered a
pair of sad, wistful eyes. Her face was thin and her
hands, which clasped tightly upon her lap a carefully
wrapped bundle, were thin and rough as if with toil.
Her eyes were anxiously examining the faces in the
carriage. At every unusual noise or sudden jolt, they
would look frightened and she would clasp still more
closely the bundle in her lap. It was a bundle about
eighteen inches long, tied and double knotted most
carefully in a piece of coarse but clean white cloth.
The girl's white sari was also as clean as most Indian
white clothes ever look, washed in dirty water and
dried on the ground as they are. She was evidently
on some important journey and, as evidently, for the
first time on a train. The bundle which she carried
would not have been noticeable among such a myriad
of bundles as the carriage held, had she not guarded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>it so closely, and, when any one changed a seat or
passed by her, shielded it with her arms.</p>

<p>After comparative peace had reigned a little while,
the frightened look left the young woman's eyes and,
untying one corner of the bundle, which opening
showed still another wrapping within, she drew out
a cold chapati and ate it slowly as if to make it last
a long time. As she ate, her eyes met those of a
sociable looking, old, gray-haired woman, evidently
of low caste, who, sitting opposite between two high
caste women, was apparently longing to talk to some
one. As their eyes met, the older woman leaned
across the aisle and said to the young girl in Hindustani:</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>The girl looked alarmed, as the question was
addressed her, but answered timidly, "To Benares.
Are you going there?"</p>

<p>"No, but I am going almost as far as that. You
see I have been ayah to master's little boy and they
moved away and now they have sent for me to come
and I am going to be his ayah again." The old
woman's face beamed as she chattered. "I might
have gone long ago when they went, for they always
called me a fine ayah and always praised me to all of
their guests, but when they moved away to Allahabad
I did not want to leave my family. But my boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>went off to the city and&mdash;and&mdash;my little girl died;
so now I am glad to go." Her eyes had filled with
tears as she said that her little girl had died and at
the words the young woman involuntarily clutched at
the bundle in her lap.</p>

<p>Just then the Brahmin woman in the corner
opposite got up to arrange her dress and moved
about in the aisle so that the conversation was interrupted.
And the two women got no further chance
to talk until the train pulled into a station and some
of the passengers getting out gave the old lady an
opportunity to slip into the seat beside the girl.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?" she asked, resuming the
conversation at once.</p>

<p>"From C&mdash;&mdash;," the girl answered.</p>

<p>"Are you a sweeper?" the old lady continued her
catechism. "Do you work at it?" she went on
without waiting for an answer. "There is lots of
money in that work, isn't there? I never had to
work at it, you know."</p>

<p>The young girl looked at her frankly. "I don't
think so. I got two annas a day."</p>

<p>"Oh, my! I get ten rupees a month!"</p>

<p>The girl opened her eyes in surprise. "And what
do you do?" she questioned in return.</p>

<p>"I am an ayah, I told you. All I have to do is to
take care of the little boy. He is a dear, good boy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>I dress him in the morning and give him his breakfast
and watch him at play. I get his tiffin and then
put him to sleep. After he wakes up I dress him all
up fine and take him out in the compound in the
carriage and usually his mother walks with us a little
and then I give him an early supper and put him to
bed and sit in the room with him until his mother
comes up-stairs. Wouldn't you like to do that? It
just isn't work at all and yet I get ten rupees a month
for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I would like to! But I'd never get a chance
to do that," the girl said sadly.</p>

<p>"Were you ever in a sahib's house?" the old
woman ambled on, seeing that the girl was really interested
and impressed. "It is a great, big place, as
big as that station almost," and the old woman
pointed out to a station at which they were just stopping.</p>

<p>"My husband used to go to one sometimes," said
the girl, and, clutching at her bundle, her face grew
sad again.</p>

<p>"You are a widow?" asked the other, although
she must have known from the girl's dress that she
was.</p>

<p>"Yes, my husband has been dead two years."
She paused a moment and then as if she could restrain
herself no longer, as if the flood of her speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>had been loosened, she went on rapidly in a low but
intense tone. "Yes, for two years he has been dead.
He was not sick long. I was but a girl. I did not
know very much about it except that he was sick and
that they made offerings to the gods and did all they
could to cure him. But one day my mother-in-law
came to me and called me terrible names and told
me that if my husband died I would be to blame and
that awful things would happen to me. She frightened
me terribly and told me that I must not let him
die. So I crept away to the temple. I had no offering
to make except as I stole a handful of rice in
the bazaar and took that. I prayed and prayed.
At one temple the priests said that they would cure
him for ten rupees but I had no money and I was
afraid to go and tell my mother-in-law. A priest
at another shrine said that a little Ganges water
might help my husband and, as I turned away in despair,
for I did not know where the Ganges was, I
heard him say to a man standing there, 'When I die
I am going to the Ganges and die there so that my
bones may be thrown into the river and Mother
Gunga may hold them upon her bosom; then shall I
be forever happy.' But I had done all I could by
my prayers and so I crept back home to find my
husband&mdash;dead.&mdash;But I remembered what the priest
had said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span></p><p>"My mother-in-law beat me. She took my jewels
away from me. She shaved my head and drove me
from the house. But I got work as a sweeper and
for two years I have swept up the scrapings in the
streets and made fuel cakes. I never went back to
my husband's home."</p>

<p>Her story told, to which the old woman had listened
with sympathy, the girl covered her face with
her sari and, clasping her bundle in her arms, sat
silent, shaking occasionally as with sobs.</p>

<p>Finally the other woman put her hand upon the
girl's arm to soothe her. "What are you going to
Benares for?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span></p><p>"I am going to Benares," was the only answer the
girl made.</p>

<p>Most of the women had left the carriage by this
time and night was coming on. The old lady
leaned over to the window and peered out through
the semi-darkness.</p>

<p>"There is the Ganges River&mdash;Holy Mother
Gunga!" she cried.</p>

<p>The girl started up and eagerly looked from the
window, too. "Is that the Ganges River?" she
asked and looked and looked until the last gleam of
the water was lost as the train sped on.</p>

<p>"What are you going to Benares for?" the old
woman asked again.</p>

<p>"I am going to Benares," the girl answered again
with a frightened stare, clutching her bundle.</p>

<p>As there were but few passengers left, the two
women soon lay down at full length on the hard
benches and went to sleep. But the girl did not use
her bundle for a pillow as her companion had suggested
but lay with it in her arms.</p>

<p>Before the sun was up the next morning, the
younger woman was awake and staring out with
frightened eyes as the train ran through a country
entirely strange to her. And when the old woman
woke up and announced that soon she must be getting
off, the girl's fear seemed to increase.</p>

<p>"Is the Ganges River near here, too?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, I think so," the old woman replied and
her statement was confirmed by another woman in
the next seat.</p>

<p>"Then I'll get off here with you," announced the
girl with a brighter look. "If the Ganges River is
here, this place should do as well as Benares, I think."</p>

<p>The older woman looked astonished but offered
no objections to the girl's sudden change of plan.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the train stopped at Allahabad
and again arose the mad confusion of a large railway
station at train time. But the old woman got out
safely, followed closely by the girl, holding her
bundle tightly in her arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span></p><p>They stepped aside from the crowd and the old
woman looked at the younger in curiosity as to what
she would do here in Allahabad. The appearance
of the latter had suddenly changed. Her face was
eager and her eyes were bright.</p>

<p>"Take me to the Ganges River quickly," she demanded,
"for I must throw these into the sacred
river," and she held out her bundle.</p>

<p>"What is in it?" asked the old lady, eyeing
the strange bundle with a frightened look such
as the girl herself had worn until the excitement
of being near her goal had driven it from her
face.</p>

<p>"I must throw them into the Ganges River," repeated
the girl. "They are my husband's bones,"
she whispered eagerly, lowering her voice. "When
they burned his body I crept along and after all had
left I picked them out of the pile of ashes and here
they are!" she exclaimed triumphantly. "For two
years I have kept them near me day and night and
saved all my money to come to Benares to throw
them into the Ganges River that I might be forgiven
for his death and that he might have life and happiness
as the priest said. But if the Ganges River is
here, surely this place will do as well as Benares. I
am so tired! I am so tired of being a cursed
woman!" she sobbed, her excitement giving way to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>tears. "I want to be happy. Take me to the Ganges
River!"</p>

<p>The old woman's expression had turned from
fright to astonishment as she heard what the bundle
contained; but at the girl's sobs her face grew sweet
with a motherly tenderness. She turned away as if
to think, murmuring to herself, "The memsahib will
surely forgive me if I come a little late. She would
like to have me help this poor child, I know, and perhaps
she might make her an ayah like me if I take
her with me. That would make the girl happy, indeed.
Yes, I will help her."</p>

<p>Then she turned back to the girl. Tenderly taking
her free hand, for one still tightly clasped the
precious bundle, the old woman said, "Come, we will
find the way to the sacred river."</p>

<p>Quickly the two went down the platform, now
somewhat thinned of the earlier crowd, and passed
through the station gate, the old woman still holding
the girl's hand and the girl still tightly holding the
bundle which was to be the price of life and happiness
to her.</p><hr class="chap" />

Bachelor Dreams</h2>

<p>Caldwell-Sahib, opening his eyes, let
his head roll slowly over on his pillow.
As the veranda door came within his line
of vision the delicious drowsiness which had held
him was suddenly disturbed, for there stood, looking
out across the rows of potted plants to the
dry lawn beyond, a woman whom he had never
seen. For several moments he simply stared in
weakness. Then, trying to brush away the strange,
sickly haze which enveloped his brain, he let his eyes
rove over the room as far as he could without physical
effort. There in the corner was his desk. There,
hanging above it, was the picture of the Taj which he
had bought when Parsons had paid him a flying
visit from England and they had gone to Agra together.
Just to the right, out of the edge of his eye,
he could see the foot of his steamer chair and, extending
from beneath it, the hand-woven rug which
he himself had spent a week in buying from a native
dealer in Delhi, holding grimly to his first bid each day
as he had passed the shop on his constitutional until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>a bargain had been struck the very day his train
pulled out. Those things certainly belonged to him,
but the woman did not. Where had she come from?
For there she was still as his eyes again reached the
door.</p>

<p>His strangely tired mind was just getting to the
point of realizing what she looked like&mdash;that she was
tall and fair&mdash;when the woman turned her face
towards him and with a smile came to the bed.</p>

<p>"So you are awake and better. That's good!
You will be all right now. Let me feel your pulse,
please," and pulling the omnipresent mosquito netting
aside, she laid a cool hand upon his wrist. "That
is all right too. Your pulse is normal. Isn't that
splendid!</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me," she continued after a deft
fluffing of his pillows and a careful tucking in of the
netting. "I'm sorry, but you've got to be your own
nurse now. Your boy is frightened to death, but
he'll stay with you and do your bidding. You'll be
all right. I must go. Take one teaspoonful of this
every hour," and she lifted a tumbler from the table.
"At seven o'clock take half of this in the cup here,"
and she brought a flowered teacup into view.
"Don't get up until you really feel strong enough to.
Have your boy give you broths to-morrow, an egg
the next day, and so on, getting back to your regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>diet by degrees. I guess you are used to being your
own nurse."</p>

<p>She turned towards the door. "I'll get your boy
in but you will have to make him stay. I can't wait
to do that."</p>

<p>She left the room, but soon returned followed
slowly and reluctantly by his "boy," only a boy in
Anglo-Indian nomenclature, for he was a tiny native
man about forty years of age, who was bowing
and salaaming but keeping as near to the door as
possible.</p>

<p>"Come," said the lady in a low but compelling
tone. "Come. Come along quickly," she added a
trifle sharply as he lagged behind. "Aren't you
ashamed to have left your master when he was sick!
Now," for he had reached the bed by this time,
"lift the netting and take hold of the sahib's hand."</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed as he touched the Englishman's
hand and took his own quickly away.
"There! You see it didn't hurt you. You haven't
caught the cholera. Now, do as your master tells
you; take good care of him and behave as a boy
should," and she was gone.</p>

<p>Ah! Cholera! That explained it all to Caldwell.
So he had had the cholera, he&mdash;Caldwell&mdash;who had
served the government for fifteen years in India, had
taken every risk, and had considered himself immune!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>That explained his extreme weakness, his befuddled
brain, and the unusual soreness of his
muscles. That explained the terror of his boy. But
it did not explain the woman. Where had she come
from? Who was she?</p>

<p>For some time Caldwell thought over this interesting
matter, for it was easier just to think than to
question the shivering boy who was still crouching
as close to the outside door as possible. Who was
she? She was tall and thin; her face was very fine-featured
and intelligent. And she was an American.
He knew that last fact from her speech and from her
appearance, too, for although Caldwell never had
looked at ladies in his life, especially American
ladies, except when politeness absolutely compelled
him to, yet even he could not mistake the something
in the appearance that marks every American girl,
and,&mdash;yes, secretly approve, although his English
nature would not let him acknowledge it. And she
wasn't very old either!</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck him, so suddenly and
such a thought that he almost started up in spite of
his weakness. There was only one other European
in Baihar besides himself and that was a missionary,
a woman,&mdash;a doctor, he had understood, and&mdash;an
American.</p>

<p>"Boy," as strong a voice as a usually strong Englishman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>could command after a fit of cholera demanded,
"was that the missionary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib, I got her. She's a doctor-memsahib,
master."</p>

<p>"Boy, did you run away and leave me?" Caldwell
continued, remembering the words of the woman to
the boy and making his tone as sepulchral as possible
in order to frighten the man still more.</p>

<p>"I ran to get the doctor-memsahib, master,"
shivered out the unhappy fellow, ignoring in his
reply his later entire disappearance while the doctor-memsahib
was left for five hours to struggle alone
for Caldwell-Sahib's life.</p>

<p>But Caldwell-Sahib, although suspecting the truth,
was in no state just then either by chastisement or
preaching to teach the beauty of courage and self-sacrifice.
So he sank back upon his pillow and gave
himself to thought.</p>

<p>During the next few days, while his strength was
returning, Caldwell-Sahib had plenty of time to think
and, for the first time in his bachelor life, his thoughts
centred about a woman&mdash;for he knew cholera and he
knew that the doctor-memsahib had saved his life.</p>

<p>The boy, emboldened by feeling no symptoms of
the dread disease in his own system, gradually took
up his accustomed duties and cared for his master's
wants in the quick, noiseless, and perfect way of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>well-trained Indian servant that soothes a man's
soul. So for several days with the punkah swinging
over him the convalescent lay stretched out upon his
steamer chair, the very picture of comfort and pleasant
dreams. To have one's life saved by a woman
and a good-looking one, too, touches even a crusty
heart. But to find that this was the very woman
whom for a whole month he had thought of only
with contempt and disgust broke clear through the
crustiness of Caldwell-Sahib's heart and added a little
pleasurable anxiety to the tenderness engendered
within.</p>

<p>One month before this time very suddenly the
government had sent him up to Baihar to look after
some matters which would consume about a year's
time. So having taken possession of the bungalow
built by the government for such official visits and
having moved up enough of his belongings to be
comfortable, Caldwell-Sahib had settled down for a
"dead" year such as so many government officials
live through in parts of India, as in duty bound.
Baihar, a city of about ten thousand inhabitants, is a
purely religious city, where no business is transacted
but religious business and where no pleasures are
indulged in but those of religion; those of the
Hindu religion being so vile that "Baihar" is almost
another name for Hell. Caldwell had expected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>be the only European in that whole city of blackest
Hinduism; so the prospects of a year alone in such a
place had been, indeed, anything but inviting to an
Englishman who despised the natives and who could
find no pleasure in Indian life apart from the sports
of a large cantonment or the resources of a well-stocked
library.</p>

<p>However, after he had been in Baihar but a few
days, he had heard that there was another European
in the city, a woman, an American missionary, who
for six years had lived alone in that horrible place in
order to bring Christian, medical help to the poor
women of that city, especially to the four thousand
Hindu widows devoted to temple worship and the
lusts of the priests. To say that Caldwell-Sahib
had been horrified at the thought of a lone woman
in that place would have put it too strongly, for he
was simply disgusted. He said that she must be
mad, certainly far beyond the realm of sense, let
alone common sense, to have undertaken such a
thing. This woman's presence in Baihar would not
make any difference with the beastly dullness of the
life ahead of him, that was certain, for he would have
nothing to do with her and he did not even want to
see her; for he hated women in general and this one
must be an especially objectionable specimen of the
species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span></p><p>But now Caldwell-Sahib had seen her and she was
sweet and wholesome to look upon. Now this very
woman had saved his life. If she had not been there
engaged in her foolish work, he would have died.
Therefore, he was full of regret for his former unkind
thoughts and he was, moreover, exceedingly
grateful, for he put considerable value on his life, did
Caldwell-Sahib, and to be less than grateful to
her who had saved it would be to prove himself less
than a man.</p>

<p>During the days of convalescence the Englishman's
thoughts turned often to the probable experiences of
the six years that this sweet American woman had
spent alone in this "Hell." Even his stout English
heart recoiled at the mental pictures his mind conjured
up. He could see her threading her way alone
through the crowded bazaars where vile Hindu
priests, dirty shopkeepers, men red-faced with smallpox,
or hideous lepers must again and again have
jostled rudely against her. He saw her, unattended,
with difficulty passing the frenzied religious processions
which accompany the silver car of the great
god as it makes its sacred rounds, or being pushed to
the wall by a surging mass of religious devotees,
eager to reach the sacred river to bathe in its holy
waters. But the worst picture to him was of the
nights of those six years when unprotected she must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>have crouched within her chamber in fright at the
awful and unholy confusion of night in a Hindu
city.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;&mdash;!" He pulled himself up short. "I
must not swear, for she is a missionary, but by&mdash;by&mdash;by
Oliver Cromwell, I'll save her from all that."</p>

<p>The instinct of gratitude will assert itself and it is
easy for gratitude to pass over into affection and enduring
devotion. When the rescuer is a beautiful
and capable woman, who can measure the consequences?
All of Caldwell-Sahib's philosophy of
life was thrown into confusion. His complex nature
would no longer run according to his will. Staid,
cold, hard, matter-of-fact Englishman though he was,
his imagination played fantastic tricks with him and
so through all these days while his body was regaining
its lost strength, her face lived in his memory and
the memory gave him a warm and comforting sensation
about the heart, a sensation intensified in its delight
by the thought that she was probably thinking
about him, for so the old romance has run since the
beginning of the human drama.</p>

<p>As soon as Caldwell-Sahib was able to get out, he
inquired his way to her home. He had an easy
time finding it, for everybody seemed to know where
she lived and every face brightened at her name.
But when he reached the compound and through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>gate saw the plain but comfortable bungalow within,
his courage gave way and he turned back home.
However, he got into the habit of strolling around
that way towards nightfall and standing a few
minutes at the point of the wall nearest to what he
thought her window and watching the people who
came and went from her compound; but never on
these occasions did he catch a glimpse of her. As a
courageous and polite Englishman, he should have
gone in and thanked the good American lady for
having saved his life, but he had grown to feel that
there was only one way in which he wanted to
thank her and he had not yet reached the height of
courage where he could tell her how she had
wrecked his philosophy of life. So he lingered
around outside the compound walls and watched the
natives; "lucky beggars" he called them to himself,
as they came and went from a small, low building at
one side of the compound which he knew from appearance
must be her dispensary. Those who
passed him were lame and halt and, yes, even blind.
But they were all "lucky" in his sight because they
had been in her presence and had been speaking to
her.</p>

<p>He overheard their remarks occasionally and now
it was: "It hurt awfully but she put her hand on
my head and took all the pain away;" or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>"She gave
me the worst medicine to take, but since she said
'Take it!' I will;" and even the blind man said as
he passed, a strange light in his face, "She says to
come to-morrow and she will cut something in my
eyes and then she thinks I shall see again. Since
she says it will be all right, I am coming back to-morrow,
but I wouldn't believe any one else."</p>

<p>Caldwell-Sahib's heart ached for the sweet, clean
American woman who must touch, heal, and minister
to such foul, dirty creatures. Every night as he
watched them he felt that he ought to go in and tell
her of his love and take her away from such a dreadful
life at once. Possibly she was wondering why he
had not come. How cruel he was to delay! But
every night home he would go again and put off the
visit, bachelor-like, until the next day.</p>

<p>However fate took a hand in the affair at last.
One day a couple of months after his illness, as Caldwell-Sahib
was standing in the narrow bazaar with,
for a wonder, very few people about, he saw a lady's
topi above some sari-covered heads turn into the
street at the corner.</p>

<p>Caldwell-Sahib could not conceal from himself
that his heart was beating with strangely quickened
throbs. This sight of the woman who had saved his
life and for weeks had filled his thoughts now
brought to him an overwhelming consciousness that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>his bachelor dreams were at an end, that his hour
had come, the happiest of a man's life; for when a
man sees for the first time the light of love in the
eyes of the woman whom he loves, that is the
happiest hour of life. She came nearer. He could
hear her voice, low in Hindustani, addressing a
young native girl at her side.</p>

<p>For a blissful moment he watched her approach,
saw the grace of her carriage, the pretty bend of her
head as she talked with the girl, the slender, strong
hands which had ministered to him and saved his
life. He saw also, in anticipation, the light in her
eyes and the blush upon her cheek when she should
see him.</p>

<p>He stammered a good-morning. Strange how his
lips seemed to tremble!</p>

<p>She glanced up.</p>

<p>With unrecognizing eyes turned upon him, slightly
bowing a greeting in return, she passed on.</p>

<p>As Caldwell-Sahib stared stupidly after her, he
heard the girl say: "That was the Inspector-Sahib
whose life you saved when he had the cholera," for
apparently the girl was astonished at the lady's uninterested
manner in the presence of such an important
official.</p>

<p>Caldwell-Sahib did not hear the lady's reply, as
she and the young Hindu girl passed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span></p><p>"Oh, is that he? I had forgotten about him. I
had such a good laugh afterwards at the surprised
expression on his face when he saw me in his house
the morning he regained consciousness that I ought
to have remembered him. We must turn here, my
dear, for I must get back to my work at once."</p>

<p>So the two turned down a side street which led
to the doctor's office where at least thirty dirty, but
well-remembered and beloved native patients were
waiting for the tender treatments daily administered
by the missionary's skillful hands.</p>

<p>The Englishman still stared.</p><hr class="chap" />

The Cost</h2>

<p>Yes, that is a Bible. Oh, yes, I speak English.
I've spoken it ever since I was a young
girl. Nearly every Parsi, you know, learns
to speak English as soon as possible. We admire
English people in a great many ways and try to
emulate them in some things, although we are proud
enough to think that we are superior to them in some
others.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm a Parsi&mdash;that is&mdash;I'm a Parsi in race but
not in religion. This Bible shows you what I am in
belief. Yes, I'm a Christian, but not one of long
standing, for I was baptized only one year ago.</p>

<p>You're an American, aren't you? I thought so,
for in many ways you are like my dear Miss Miller.
Won't you have this pillow at your back? Even
second-class carriages are not any too comfortable.
If you will let me pull that leather bag out a little
from under the seat so that you can put your feet
upon it, you will rest more easily. A second-class
carriage is a luxury for me nowadays, since I became
a Christian. I really can't afford to travel any other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>way than third, but I've been a little ill the last few
weeks and Miss Miller insisted upon my coming
second this time. You look so much like Miss
Miller that you must excuse me, if I have stared at
you a little impolitely since we left Grand Avenue
Station.</p>

    <img src="images/illus12-tb.jpg" width="278" height="400" alt="Indian and American ladies talking" />
  </a>
  <br />
  <span class="caption">&quot;YOU ARE AN AMERICAN, AREN'T YOU?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Oh, an American is privileged to do that, you
know, to watch us closely, for he is here to see a new
people and to find out all he can about them. I
don't mind that at all. We really expect it. We
have so many Americans in Bombay that I have got
quite used to it and don't notice it any more. At
first I used to get embarrassed and think that they
were looking at me, but I soon found out that it was
only my clothes and my manners that they were interested
in and that they couldn't distinguish me
from any other Parsi lady; we were only a sort of
curiosity to them. It wasn't exactly flattering to find
it out, but still it made one feel more comfortable on
the streets.</p>

<p>Oh, I've got quite accustomed to it now, I assure
you. But you do resemble Miss Miller, if you don't
mind my saying so; only she wears her hair quite
plain and always dresses in gray.</p>

<p>She is my teacher.</p>

<p>Here we are at A&mdash;&mdash;. I'm just selfish enough
to hope that no other lady will want to get into this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>compartment. Since each of us has a whole seat to
herself we can be pretty comfortable.</p>

<p>There is an unusual crowd of third-class passengers
to-day, though there are always crowds here for that
matter. I don't see where they get the money for all
the travelling they do. Since so many pilgrimages
are required in their religion the people seem to work
very hard for a long time and then spend every anna
that they have saved on a pilgrimage somewhere.
But to-day is a special feast day at N&mdash;&mdash;. That is
another reason why Miss Miller insisted upon my
coming second class this time, for the third was
terribly crowded when we came down this noon.
She is so good! She left her work just to come
down and see me off, because I have been ill.</p>

<p>No, thank you. I don't care for a cup of tea now,
for I shall reach my destination in time for tea. Oh,
yes, the tea at these stations is quite safe. But I
would not take the milk if I were you, for Miss
Miller never does.</p>

<p>Oh, yes. We stop here about ten minutes. You'll
have plenty of time to drink it and the man will
come back with his tray and get your cup before the
train starts. It is two annas a cup. Don't you want
a piece of cake with it? Here, boy!</p>

<p>Yes, some of the stations have very good food.</p>

<p>The new passengers are nearly all located now and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>no one seems to be going to get in with us. I am
so glad! Now we can be nice and comfortable.</p>

<p>Yes, they do keep the plants nicely watered and
well taken care of at these stations. If they were
not so dreadfully noisy and confused at train times,
they would be pretty enough places to live in.</p>

<p>There goes the bell! Here comes your boy. I'll
hand it to him.</p>

<p>Two annas. That's right. I suppose it is hard
for you to get accustomed to our money; I believe it
is quite different from yours, is it not?</p>

<p>Oh, is that some of your American money? How
interesting! It is worth about three-quarters of a
rupee, you say? I am so glad to have seen it.
What do you call it?</p>

<p>A quarter! See, I'll use that word in speaking to
Miss Miller some time. Won't that surprise her!
She will wonder where I have learned it.</p>

<p>Now we are off and there isn't another station for
half an hour at least. Isn't that nice? Now we
can rest. Wouldn't you rather lie down?</p>

<p>That is very kind of you, for I do feel just like
talking this afternoon. This little trip is a holiday
for me, you see, and has quite excited me, almost as
much as it would my little girl. But I expect that
she is excited, too, this afternoon, for she knows I am
coming to see her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span></p><p>One little girl. I am a widow and have been so
for several years.</p>

<p>She is in school down here at A&mdash;&mdash;. And since
I've been ill, Miss Miller had me come down to see
her for a rest.</p>

<p>Indeed, I'll be glad to tell you about myself, especially
about my becoming a Christian, if you
would like to hear, for I love to tell that story. You
Christians in America are so good to send teachers
to us!</p>

<p>You are not a Christian! But I thought all
Americans were Christians!</p>

<p>Don't you believe in God?</p>

<p>You suppose there is a God but you've never
thought much about it! How strange! Don't you
believe in Christ?</p>

<p>No? Why, how can that be possible when He
has done so much for you people in America and is
doing so much for us here?</p>

<p>Do I believe in Christ? Why, of course I do.
Do you think I would be here, a penniless woman,
going to see my daughter, kept in school by charity,
if I did not believe in Jesus Christ; if I did not
know Him personally and if I had not confessed my
belief before my family and friends?</p>

<p>I can't understand why you do not believe in
Christ, unless&mdash;yes, it must be so&mdash;you have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>too busy to think about Him and you have not really
needed His help yet. You never have had any
trouble and felt all alone in the big world, without
any one to help you, have you? Until that time
comes I suppose people are too busy having a good
time to think about religion. I have noticed that
here in my teaching among my own people, but I
did not suppose it was so in America, for I thought
everybody believed there. Here I have seen that
when people are kept quiet for a time because of
sickness or sorrow, when they have time to think
and when earthly friends cannot help, then Christ
most easily makes Himself known to them. I know
this is so for I have proved it myself. And I know
Christ!</p>

<p>Yes, it does make me very happy!</p>

<p>Oh, I had forgotten this station. But we will stop
here only a few minutes and as it is a small station I
don't think any one else will get on. Here comes a
gentleman to the window.</p>

<p>Thank you. An orange would taste good and refresh
me. Although this is our cold season, it does
get pretty warm in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>Your husband? You are taking a trip around
the world for pleasure. What interesting things you
must have seen! Your husband is a lecturer. Oh,
I see, and he is taking pictures with his camera for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>his lectures, I suppose. He is going to take that
boy with his pan of sweets. See?</p>

<p>There is the bell! He got the picture just in
time.</p>

<p>Shall I go on with my story? But, please, don't
let me tire you.</p>

<p>No, I'll save my orange a little while for I cannot
eat when I have a chance to talk on this subject.
Do you know much about the Parsis?</p>

<p>Well, I'll tell you a little so that you can understand
my situation. We Parsis are Persians; but
when the Mohammedans came into our country and
began to persecute us, gained political control, and
tried to make us accept their religion by force, many
of us fled to India, most of whom are now settled
around Bombay.</p>

<p>The women all dress about as I do with a little
cotton waist, you see, and a one-coloured sari; delicate
pinks and blues are favourite colours, edged
with fancy embroidered borders, often of pure gold
or silver. We wear stockings and slippers, the
latter usually more elaborately embroidered than
mine. We wear, also, this peculiar head-binder, a
white cloth drawn tightly around the head, covering
the hair under the sari. Our men invariably dress
as Europeans these days, for that dress is so convenient,
but they may be recognized by an oddly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>shaped cap which Miss Miller says looks as if it were
made of what you in America call black oilcloth, I
think it is. Of course the sacred emblems of Parsiism
are worn under the clothing and do not show,
the shirt and the kusti.</p>

<p>Our people have lived in India for many generations,
but they have kept themselves separate from
the other peoples. There has been very little intermarriage;
we have kept our own religion; and we
are practically a distinct people. Of course in our
religion and our social customs we have been somewhat
influenced by the Hindus and Mohammedans
among whom we have lived so long; but we differ
from them greatly. We believe in education and
begin to teach our children early in life. We believe
in monogamy and a happy family life. We are industrious,
keen, and honest in business; and I am not
overstating facts when I tell you that we are the
bankers and most important business people in India.
Of course we are not many in number compared
with the dense population of this great land, but we
are scattered throughout the whole of it, and hold, as
a rule, the places of greatest influence.</p>

<p>Let me throw your orange peel out of this window
which is already open. You've let your husband
take your satchel into his compartment and you
haven't a towel? That's too bad! I have a perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>clean one in my bag; won't you please use
it?</p>

<p>Oh, please don't mention it. I assure you it is a
pleasure to me. I suppose you are more accustomed
to the first-class lavatories, but, really, our second-class
accommodations are comfortable; don't you
think so?</p>

<p>No, indeed. I don't mind interruptions in my
story. I'll rearrange my bag while you are gone,
for I packed in a hurry and I don't just know where
my things are.</p>

<p>It is convenient to have a lavatory for every compartment.
Isn't it so in America? You don't have
compartments at all! Why, how funny! I can't imagine
what your trains must be like. Miss Miller
says that she will take me to America with her some
time. But I don't believe I'd like to leave India even
for a little while, interesting as America must be.</p>

<p>Yes, I'll go on with my story. Well, I was the
daughter of a wealthy Parsi in Bombay and we had a
beautiful home in a part of the city which is now not
quite so pleasant, for Bombay as it has grown
towards one million in population has changed very
much. I had a governess and even at ten I began
the study of English in connection with my regular
lessons and music. When I was about thirteen, my
father, who was really a little more advanced than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>the average Parsi, decided to have English only
spoken in our household. Knowing the value of the
language in commercial relations he considered it a
very important part of an education.</p>

<p>But I must tell you about our, that is the Parsi, religion.
We are the followers of Zoroaster, you
know, and we believe that God is represented by
fire. Therefore fire is sacred and in our temples a
fire is always kept burning, with an order of priesthood
to care for it. You can see how this belief
might degenerate and become a worship of fire itself,
as I fear it has with many people. Even the fires in
our homes have to be cared for with ceremonies of
various kinds. We are taught that one should be
faithful to his wife; that every one should be charitable.
But we do believe in demons and must go
through all sorts of rites to keep them away. You
see I can't give you more than the briefest account
of our belief, for it is more or less complicated as all
beliefs are, but I wanted you to see that in almost
every way it is superior to the other religions of
India, but still lacking the vital elements of Christianity.
One strange thing about our teaching is that
we are not told to try to get converts; indeed, the
Parsis do not want any new believers. Isn't that
strange? Really, I must confess that I think we are
a very self-satisfied people in every respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span></p><p>At first we did not believe in early marriages, but
in that respect we have been gradually influenced by
the Hindus. So at fourteen I was married to the
son of a rich merchant. Of course my husband was
chosen for me, but he proved to be a fine young man
and we were very happy together. Part of the wedding
ceremonies took place, as our weddings usually
do, in the large public wedding hall which probably
you saw in Bombay. Really, the customs have got
to be so elaborate that a poor Parsi can hardly marry
off a child without being in debt for the rest of his
life. Fortunately our family, as I have said, did not
lack for money and everything was beautiful. It
was, indeed, a very happy and joyous occasion, a
prophecy of our life together. For we were very,
very happy for eight years. My husband was an unusual
young man and gave promise of surpassing his
father in business sagacity and literary ability. Our
little girl came after two years of marriage and she
was dearly beloved by him, although, of course, he
would have liked a son. We were happy, oh, so
happy! After he died it used to hurt me so to think
about it that for two years I never spoke of my married
life to any one, but since I have found Jesus, I
love to think about it and speak of it.</p>

<p>But one day our joy was turned to sadness and
our gladness to grief, for my husband was smitten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>with enteric fever. You know how prevalent that is
here in India and how often fatal. He had been
overworking at his office and in the study. Our
family was too enlightened to believe that the illness
was caused by demons, as most of our people
do, and he was not neglected as most of our sick
people are, but he had the best of English medical
attention and the most tender nursing from us. He
was young and strong and we fought hard, but after
six weeks of deepest anxiety and all the devotion I
could lavish upon him, I saw him sink away and
leave me.</p>

<p>They took me from him while they prepared him
for our peculiar funeral rites and while I myself had
to go through certain ceremonies of purification.
You have been to the Towers of Silence in Bombay?
No? But you are going back next week. Well,
when you stand upon the terrace and look across to
those great towers, black around the tops with ugly
vultures, think of me as on that day three years ago
I stood and watched.&mdash;Please excuse my tears, but I
don't usually tell this part of my story; it is too
sacred; but I don't think you could understand the
rest without knowing these customs of ours. You
know that the elements, earth, air, fire, and water,
are sacred in the sight of the Parsis and cannot be
defiled by the dead; therefore we cannot bury our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>dead; we cannot burn them; nor can we throw their
corpses into the river to be carried away by its current.
So our ancestors devised the plan which we
now use. Our dead are exposed upon high towers
and vultures are allowed to tear away the flesh, leaving
the bones to crumble. So we Parsis in Bombay
have, upon a hill overlooking the harbour, really the
most beautiful spot in the city, a park in which at
the top of the hill are located five white towers between
twenty-five and fifty feet high. The park is
well cared for and contains a shrine where fire is always
burning. A high terrace looks out towards
the towers, about five hundred feet away, which are
never approached except by the officers of the dead.</p>

<p>Yes, visitors are admitted to the garden by permit
before nine in the morning. After that time the
grounds are kept clear for funerals and mourners
who come to pray for the dead.</p>

<p>I need not tell you of the long, sorrowful approach
to the gardens on that day three years ago, or how,
standing upon the terrace, I saw that dear body
borne to the tower to become the prey of the ugly
birds swarming about the gardens. I need not tell
you either of my loneliness in our home or of my return
to my father's house with only one desire in
life, to bring up my child so that she should be an
honour to her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span></p><p>For a year my life was very bare and my heart
very heavy. I had plenty of money; I wanted for
nothing; I was tenderly cared for by my family, for,
you know, the Parsis do not treat their widows after
the customs of the Hindus; but nothing seemed to
make me even one tiny bit happier. Then one day
a white lady called at our home. She was very
pleasant and kind. She showed us a book of a new
religion which she wanted us to read and she offered
to come and read it with us every day; but my
mother did not care to hear about any other religion
than our own. Then the lady showed us some
beautiful embroidery which we did not know how to
do. When my mother expressed a wish to learn the
new work, the lady offered to teach her if she might
also read from the Bible at every lesson. I, too,
liked to keep my fingers busy and when my mother,
who excelled at needlework, could not resist the
temptation and consented to let Miss Miller come,
for it was indeed she, I was glad.</p>

<p>Once a week she came and for an hour at a time
taught us various kinds of stitches and read and explained
the Bible to us. My mother, after a short
time, became ill and could not attend the lessons,
but as I seemed to enjoy them and my mind was
somewhat diverted by them from my sorrow, she
still continued to allow Miss Miller to come. So I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>who had become very much interested in the Bible,
much more so than in the sewing, used to let my
embroidery lie untouched while sometimes we would
talk for a couple of hours of this Christ religion.
What a beautiful religion it seemed to me! What a
comforting religion! I would have something to
live for and something to work for if I were a Christian.
I thought of my husband's death with less bitterness,
for this religion taught that I would surely
see him again if I did God's will. Finally one day,
one year ago, Christ spoke to my heart. I believed.
I knew that Christ not only had lived but that He
still lives. I cried for joy, but Miss Miller thought
it was with grief and started to console me. But
when I looked up with a shining face, her face shone
too.</p>

<p>"You have found Jesus!" she said.</p>

<p>I answered eagerly, "I have."</p>

<p>And right there in my own chamber where she
had been coming since my mother's illness, we knelt
and prayed.</p>

<p>When we arose, I said, "I want to be baptized and
become a Christian."</p>

<p>"You are a Christian now, my dear," she said.</p>

<p>"But I want the world to know it," I affirmed.</p>

<p>"That is right and brave," she answered, "but
you must count the cost first."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span></p><p>Then she sat down beside me and gently told me
what I would have to bear if I publicly took the
name of Christ. She said that there were not more
than twenty-five Parsi Christians in the whole world.
She said that probably I would be turned out of my
home, that my relatives would count me as dead,
that all my wealth would be taken from me and that
I would not have one anna for myself or my child.</p>

<p>"Think of your child! Think of yourself! I cannot
urge you to do it. You must decide for yourself."</p>

<p>I answered quickly, "I have thought of myself. I
have thought of my child. She must be a Christian
and be brought up as such. Miss Miller, I have decided
for myself. Jesus will take care of us. I
know it in my heart for He tells me so."</p>

<p>So I made my decision and she said no more, but
I knew she was pleased by the smile that she gave
me. I would not wait for one instant lest influences
might be brought to bear which I could not resist
and I might be prevented from declaring my desire
and fulfilling it. I took Miss Miller's hand and we
went at once to my mother's room. She was not
dangerously ill. When she heard my determination
to become a Christian, she sent for my father from
his study. Together they listened as I told all again.</p>

<p>"Is that decision final, my daughter?" asked my
father at last, a man always of few words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span></p><p>"It is," I answered with a heart yearning towards
them but firm.</p>

<p>"Then you must go from our home, from our
family. You and yours can no longer be a part of
us in any way. You will receive nothing from us
for your support.&mdash;You are dead to us.&mdash;If you repent
of this folly," he added, turning back from the
door towards which he had started with bowed head,
"communicate with me and half of my fortune
will be yours. But if you persist in this strange
conduct," his voice grew very stern, "in ten minutes
you and yours must be gone from this
house."</p>

<p>I tried to kiss my mother good-bye but her face
was turned from me towards the wall.</p>

<p>I returned to my apartment, took my child, my
belongings and a few relics of my husband and our
happy life together and within ten minutes I had left
my home, perhaps forever,&mdash;but I don't think so. I
believe that some day God will send me back to
them at their own request; for they will yet believe
as I do, I feel assured.</p>

<p>Miss Miller took me to her own home and trained
me. I have been a Bible woman for six months now
and Christians in America pay my salary. By a
scholarship they also help me support and educate
my daughter in a Christian school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span></p><p>Am I not sorry? Look at me! I used to ride
always in the first-class carriage; my saris were of
silk and my borders embroidered with gold; but
there was sorrow in my heart. Now, I may sit on a
hard bench, crowded by dirty Hindus and my clothes
may be of the cheapest cotton, but I am happy, for
Christ has put joy into my life and into the life to
come. He has also given me something important to
do for Him. The lives of most of our Indian women
are so empty! In the first-class carriage I used to have
few fellow travellers; now in the third I have many,
sad, needy women to whom I can tell the great story
of which my own story is only a dim reflection.
And to some of these women in the last six months
God has given me the joy of revealing His love
through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Well, if here isn't our station! Hasn't the time
flown!</p>

<p>I hope I haven't wearied you.</p>

<p>Thank you very much! Kind words stay in one's
memory such a long time and come back to
strengthen in lonely or hard hours. I am so glad
that you enjoyed my story. Won't you take time
to think a little about Jesus yourself? I don't understand
how an American woman, with all God has
given her, can say that she does not believe in Him
and love Him and His Son!</p>

<p>Oh, you are going to get off here too! Will I
come up to the hotel some time and see you? Indeed,
I shall be delighted to! And will I bring my
little girl? How happy she will be to come! You
must excuse my excitement for I haven't seen her
for two months, you know. There, she sees me!
How well and happy she looks! Will I bring my

gladly will I. Here, dear, this way! Good-bye!

Among the Clouds</h2>

<p>The conversation had drifted by mysterious
and unexplained associations of ideas from
the unusual excellence of the sweets served
at the end of dinner upon this line of steamers, to
the most grewsome tales of adventure which the
narrators themselves had experienced. Gladys, who
by the most special of special permissions and the
kind favour of the captain, because she was an only
child, well behaved at table, and&mdash;because it was off
season&mdash;had been permitted to take Sunday dinner
with her parents, sat beside the captain in the
gorgeous first cabin saloon with round eyes fixed
upon the story-tellers.</p>

<p>There was present at dinner the usual shipboard
mixture of society: at the captain's right, a man
whose extensive business interests called him often
into these waters; next, a gentleman and his wife,
travelling for their united healths; third, a government
official returning to India after a brief holiday;
on the opposite side, two globe-trotters, an American
lady from Southern India, Gladys' father, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>finally Gladys herself. The chair between the little
girl and her father was vacant, for Gladys' mother,
who had been at dinner, feeling the slight roll of the
boat, had retired early to her cabin, leaving the child
to the father's care.</p>

<p>If her mother had been there Gladys would not
have been permitted to listen to the stories which
had been told and enjoy the delicious sensations of
fear which she had experienced as she had heard the
accounts of awful dangers and marvellous escapes.
The merchant had obliged this little dinner company
to spend five days with him without food on a desert
island and, after a thrilling rescue, had made them
watch him fall seventy feet from the masthead of a
ship to become the ship-surgeon's pet patient with
twenty bones to set. Gladys had felt herself wasting
away with starvation as he had told of his sufferings
and, when he had cheerfully reached his second
story, she could hear her own bones grate as if
broken asunder, as she moved her legs under the
table.</p>

<p>Soon it came the turn of the lady from Southern
India to tell a story.</p>

<p>"Well, I have had one thrilling experience which
I don't mind telling you, if my courage will support
me through the recital," she said.</p>

<p>Gladys listened with all her ears, for the lady from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>Southern India had become her best friend on shipboard.
She did not want to miss a single word.</p>

<p>"You know that I have been a resident of Southern
India for many years," the lady began. "I
could tell many dreadful stories of pestilence and
disaster in that region, but the most awful experience
that I have ever had myself took place in
Northern India, in Darjeeling. Of course you all
know Darjeeling."</p>

<p>But in spite of her own assurance that they did,
the lady did not seem to be able to resist, as no one
who loves the Himalayas can, telling again of that
city among the clouds, seven thousand feet above
the sea, looking directly across the depths to where,
when the sun permits, shine forth the snowy peaks
of Kinchenjunga. The little city on the sheer
mountainside is to the world only another proof of
the audacity of man who dares to invade regions
so exalted and, in the hope of drenching his lungs,
parched by the heat of the Indian plains, with the
cool air from the never-melting snows of the mountain
peaks, dares to build his summer cottage on the
overhanging rock and trust to Providence that it will
not tumble headlong into the clouds below or, rained
on from the clouds above, be carried down the
mountainside and buried in unknown depths by the
dbris of an ever-possible landslip. Clinging to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>edges of the crest of this mountain height or
perched upon the very crest itself, the summer
homes of the "sahibs" peer out through their enclosures
of shrubbery and trees to the snow-capped
heights where even their masters dare not venture,
but from looking upon which these men gain
courage to go down again to the plains to take up
their heavy tasks, "the white man's burden."</p>

<p>In her ardour the lady from Southern India described
even the ascent of the foot-hills to this resort
among the mountains: the wide views appearing
first on one side, then on the other, as the little train
winds its way up the mountainside, sometimes making
complete circles to reach the higher grades and
at other times shunting backwards to save a long dtour.
The tea-gardens on the hillsides, the luxuriance
of the vegetation in the wooded glens, the
waterfalls, the odd little native villages along the
road, descriptions of all these the table company
listened to with pleasure, for they deserved attention,
coming from the lips of one who was
very familiar with the scenes of which she spoke
and who loved them. Even Gladys, who was afraid
of mountains, because "they look so big and black,"
wished she might have been there by the time the
lady had reached the beginning of her story.</p>

<p>"It was on my first visit to Darjeeling, when I knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>nothing of the place or the hill people, that I had the
experience I am going to tell you about," the lady
continued. "I had often heard before I started on
the journey, and again on the way up, and yet again
as soon as I reached the city itself, that there was
one trip which every visitor must take in order to
see the full glory of the Himalayas and to get a peep
at Mt. Everest, the highest mountain in the world.
As my stay there with an old college friend was to
be brief, since Darjeeling is a long way from Madras
and vacation days do not last forever, it was to my
dismay that I found my hostess too ill to accompany
me on any excursion. She could only plan my visit
and direct her servants to carry out her plans.</p>

<p>"As clouds and mists are apt to hide the mountains
and no one can tell when the 'sublime' heights
will be visible, it is wise to take the trip I had heard
so much about as soon as possible and to repeat it
until one gets a clear view. Therefore I felt that I
must take the first opportunity and, although I could
find no one to accompany me, I decided that I must
go the very next morning after my arrival, even
alone. The plan of the trip was this: to leave at
3:30 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> and in a dandy, a sort of chair borne by
four hillmen, to be carried five miles to Tiger Hill,
one thousand feet higher than Darjeeling; to reach
there just as the sun should rise and throw its morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>splendours upon Mt. Everest. It was decided
that I should take an alarm clock to my room and,
arising at 3 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, be ready in all the heavy clothing
I could assemble for my before-sunrise excursion.
The dandy and dandywalas were ordered and a light
lunch was set ready to serve as my chota hazri.</p>

<p>"It had not occurred to me that it would be a trying
excursion as well as an early one until at 3:30
the next morning, lighted by my bedroom lamp as
far as the outside door, I opened it and saw in the
dimness of the light four figures emerge from the
darkness beyond and stand about some object on the
ground which I supposed must be the dandy. There
was no one to say good-bye to me or give me a last
word of counsel or warning. I put out the light,
closed the door behind me, and took a few steps in
the direction where I thought the dandy was. Then
I stopped, for accustomed to speak to the natives
in their own tongue, it had not occurred to me until
that moment that these hill people spoke a different
language from the one I was familiar with and so I
could not hope to make them understand a word. I
remembered, too, that they were of Mongolian descent,
very different from the Indian people whom I
knew. What were their characteristics? They
might be treacherous and prone to rob for all I knew.
But after a moment's hesitation I made up my mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>that all these thoughts were foolish, for certainly my
friend would not have planned this trip for me if she
had not considered it perfectly safe. I saw that I
must go on or that I should never hear the last of
my cowardice from my co-workers in India who are
very fond of a good joke on any of their fellows.</p>

<p>"My eyes had become more accustomed to the
darkness while I had been cogitating thus, and so,
taking my rugs and my life, as it seemed to me, in
my hands, I stepped resolutely towards the dandy
which was placed ready for me. I spread out one
rug carefully and arranged my pillows upon it for
comfort, just as calmly as if I had made the trip
often. Then I sat down and pulled the other rug
over me. When I appeared to be all ready, the
four men, just black shapes in the darkness, with a
queer united grunt, took hold of the chair poles,
two in front and two behind, and, lifting the dandy
to their shoulders, started at a slow pace up the hill
behind the house.</p>

<p>"I was pretty high up in the world it seemed to
me and as they were carrying me up backwards I
had a view before me of all the mountainside that
was visible in the starlight, for the stars were very
bright overhead, and the street lights of the city
twinkled here and there below. I tried to forget that
my destination was five miles away and that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>paths might lead through lonely solitudes. I tried
to concentrate my thoughts upon the scene before
me, the city, as it were, beside the sea; for so the
clouds looked in the dimness with the lighted streets
resembling long piers running out into the cloud sea.
Near by an occasional house loomed up darkly in
the shadows, and the overhanging trees from the
slope above looked like impenetrable forests in
the darkness. Far to the left a dim light, I felt sure,
marked the spot where a terrible landslip had occurred
but shortly before and several English people
had lost their lives. I had been anxious to visit the
spot since reading an account of the disaster, but
somehow in the darkness, even at that distance,
although I could not see the place, a sort of horror
of it took possession of me and I seemed to see the
white faces upturned towards the sky as they were
being carried down the mountainside by the relentless
torrent of rocks and earth. Just then I heard
a noise as of a person moving stealthily along the
narrow roadway and I positively shook with fear; but
a nearer approach revealed to me that it was only a
night watchman aroused by our passing. The gleam
of a policeman's badge in these mountain wilds
relieved my anxiety for a moment and made me
ashamed of my fears.</p>

<p>"I tried to forget my foolish thoughts and to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>soothed by the gentle motion of the dandy as the
men swung up the hillside by a circuitous roadway.
I tried not to remember what strange, stolid faces the
hillmen had had whom I had seen at the station the
day before. I tried not to see as we passed under a
street lamp, outlined under the coat of the right hand
man in front of me what certainly looked like a
revolver. I tried, as I looked up at the tall trees
almost meeting over my head, to imagine how beautiful
this road would appear by daylight. Once one
of the front bearers missed his footing by stepping
into an unexpected hole near the edge of the road.
That gave me a shock; but the physical shock was
not so great as the mental one I received when, as he
recovered himself, I thought I saw a knife at his
belt.</p>

<p>"Soon, at a low call from one of them, the four
men fell into a trot and I found myself being borne,
none too smoothly, along a bit of down grade. In a
moment the grade became still steeper and, apparently
at another signal, I was whirled about in
my chair and carried face forwards. As they toiled
up another slope and we appeared to have passed out
of the city, they began a weird antiphonal; the men
in front would chant a few words and the men behind
would finish the phrase. Over and over it sounded&mdash;the
same tones. It seemed to me that the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>two were saying, 'Kill her now. Kill her now!' and
the others were answering, 'It is not time yet. It is
not time yet!'</p>

<p>"On we went with the stars watching overhead
but clearly at such a distance that their presence gave
me but little comfort. 'Of course these men are
not saying such awful things,' I tried to reassure
myself.</p>

<p>"My teeth were chattering both with fear and
cold, for it was cold at four o'clock in the morning
seven thousand feet above the sea. Suddenly the
thought came to me to bribe these men with money,
but my shaking fingers discovered that I had left my
purse at home. So I could do nothing but just wait
and let them take their will.</p>

<p>"On we went, up and up, away from the city, farther
and farther away, at the same swinging pace and to
the same accompaniment of murderous refrain. Before
long I could see that we were approaching a fog
and very soon we were in it. At another time I
should have rejoiced at the experience of passing
through a cloud on the mountainside, but now my
only joy was in a light that shone through it. It
might be a street light and we might be coming to a
village! We were; but so small was the village and
so quickly did we pass through it that I had no time
to think of getting help there. And to cheer me on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>my way, from the last dark house I heard the wail
of a suffering child.</p>

<p>"We were soon again in the deep woods and we
must have been about an hour from our starting
point&mdash;it had seemed a century to me and I knew
that my hair had whitened with the passing of those
years&mdash;when we came to a spot where the road
broadened. There, in silence, the men set my chair
down and withdrew to one side of the road. I could
see their figures close together and I could hear their
voices as if in discussion. I knew very well that my
time had come. Oh, why had I ventured alone on
this journey, just for pleasure! What would become
of my work and my dear people in Madras, if these
men murdered me, as they surely would when they
found I had no money at all!</p>

<p>"I thought of running off into the dark woods,
but how could I hope for safety there where the wild
beasts preyed? I thought of shouting in the hope
that my voice might reach the village which we had
passed, but before help could come from there I
knew that I would surely be dead. So I did nothing.
My eyes remained fixed upon the men and,
although I thought it would be pleasanter not to see
death coming, I could not turn away. I could see
the men motioning with their arms. One man who
was walking up and down behind the others, stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>once or twice and pointed towards me. I sat frozen,
but not with the cold.</p>

<p>"At last this man stepped out from behind the
others and came towards me. He came straight to
the side of the dandy and, raising his hands to my
throat&mdash;&mdash; Why, look at that poor child!"</p>

<p>At that exclamation the company turned towards
Gladys whose eyes were fairly popping out with terror.</p>

<p>"Gladys! Dear child! I should not have told
such a thing when you were here to frighten you so.
How wrong of me! Mr. Bixby, you should not
have allowed the child to hear all this nonsense."</p>

<p>The good lady from Southern India was out of her
chair with the little girl in her arms by this time.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what did the man do?" sobbed the child.</p>

<p>"Why, dearest, he did nothing but pull my
steamer rug up around my neck and tuck me in nice
and warm. They were good, harmless men and had
only stopped to rest after their long climb. I was a
foolish, easily frightened woman. And do you
know, dear, the song they had been singing? I
found out afterwards that it was simply this, variations
of which they chant to every passenger:
'Such a big lady! Such a big lady!' the first two
sang and the answer from the other two was, 'Such
a big present! Such a big present!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span></p><p>"And I did give them a good big present when I
got safely home, you may be sure, because I was so
greatly pleased to find all my trouble had been in
my own mind, as almost all of my troubles have always
been.</p>

<p>"Now, for bed, little girl, and I'll tell you a really
nice story to go to sleep on."</p>

<p>And the lady from Southern India bore Gladys
away to her stateroom before the rest of the company
had time to make any comments upon her narration.</p><hr class="chap" />

The Infidel</h2>

<p>"Night is coming! The wildness of desolation
will soon be upon us! Oh, Allah,
Allah, hear the cry of the faithful!"</p>

<p>The old man, in Arab dress, arose unsteadily from
his knees, stuck his feet into his heelless slippers, and
stood with scraggy, gray head bowed upon his
hands.</p>

<p>"It is not the hour for prayer. Why do I thus
involuntarily fall upon my knees and call upon the
sacred name of Allah? What nameless fear is this
which has clutched at my heart all this day and
finally brought me to my knees in the guest room
of a stranger to whose home I have come on a message
for the Faith?</p>

<p>"I cannot explain it," he continued in a quavering
voice as he straightened himself up and began to
walk back and forth in the narrow guest room.
"Something terrible will soon come to pass. I
know it! I feel it! But I am bound. If I could
but leave this city to-night and start back to my
home, I feel that I would be safe. But I am bound!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>By the law of the Prophet I am bound and I cannot
go."</p>

  <span class="caption">&quot;OH, ALLAH, ALLAH, HEAR THE CRY OF THE FAITHFUL!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Night is coming! The wildness of desolation
will soon be upon us!" he repeated over and over
again as he walked back and forth from the edge of
the court to the plastered wall, back and forth.</p>

<p>The old man's voice had sunk to a murmur but he
was still repeating the same words and walking restlessly
to and fro when a noise beyond the door
across the narrow, stone-paved court attracted his attention
and he sank down upon the reception cushions
on the floor in the conventional attitude of the
Arab guest. A sackcloth curtain was lifted at the
doorway across the court and a man entered, a
native of India, with the clear-cut features of the
Aryan, but the heavy black beard and rich robes of
a prosperous Mohammedan. Every step as he
crossed the court betrayed the pride and dignity of
this follower of the Prophet. On his head was the
green turban marking the successful, faithful pilgrim
to Mecca.</p>

<p>The old man arose to prostrate himself before his
host, as with "The peace of Allah be thine!" upon
his lips the younger man stepped up from the court
into the open guest room and came towards him.
But although his lips murmured the conventional
words of greeting, the old man's eyes did not seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>to be looking at his host but out across the court as
if he saw something startling there and his figure
seemed to be all a-tremble. It was only after the
host had politely urged him to resume his seat upon
the cushions and had himself sat down, that the old
man seemed to recover himself. Without accepting
the proffered seat, however, he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ben Emeal, I come to thee as a messenger of the
Prophet."</p>

<p>"And as a messenger of the Prophet thou art
most welcome, oh, brother, whose name has not
been revealed to me," quickly responded the other,
rising as he saw that the guest would not be seated.</p>

<p>"My name does not matter, oh, faithful Believer,
so long as I come on the business of the Faith. Ben
Emeal, I have something to tell thee which I know
will fill thee with amaze and thy heart with anger
and thy mind with plans of cunning." As the old
man talked his fear seemed to leave him and he became
the proud, fearless messenger of the Faith.</p>

<p>"Ben Emeal, I have come, I have come all the
way from the land of the Holy Prophet himself, to
warn thee that the infidel is rife in the land, that the
infidel has entered the very strongholds of the Deccan,
that the infidel"&mdash;the old man stepped nearer
and fairly hissed into the face of the other, "approaches&mdash;thee!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span></p><p>The old man drew himself erect and looked with
the proud superiority of wisdom upon the other who
was gazing back in evident bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Brother, what meanest thou?" the host asked.
"I am faithful, as thou must know. No man in this
great city has been more faithful than I and I hate
the infidel with the hatred of the Prophet!" At the
word "hate," Ben Emeal's strong hand had dropped
to the sword hilt at his side.</p>

<p>The old man again brought his face close to the
other's and the words came whistling from his toothless
mouth. "Yes, thou, oh, Ben Emeal, art faithful,
but watch thou thy household! Watch thou thy
household! Watch! I shall be at the crossing of
the Sidar Ways; for three days only I shall be there.
Watch and come to me for help. I have delivered
my message; now I go!"</p>

<p>As the last words fell from his lips and he turned
towards the courtyard, all the proud fearlessness left
his face; the expression as of one doomed returned;
and with his hands raised above his head, the old
man staggered from the court, crying, "Night is
coming! The wildness of desolation is upon us!
Oh, Allah, Allah, hear the cry of the faithful!"</p>

<p>The younger man, left alone, sank upon the cushions
of the guest room and seemed lost in thought.
What meant this strange warning? His women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>were faithful, Ben Emeal knew, for they had not the
brains nor the courage nor, indeed, the opportunity
to listen to the preaching of any faith but that of
their master and lord. His servants&mdash;they really
mattered not to him&mdash;but he knew that they were
faithful, too, as he had but recently taken them to account
on the subject as a true follower of the Prophet
should. His children&mdash;&mdash;? They were too young,
all&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash; He did not even repeat the name to
himself, for from the first word of accusation his
mind had guessed the one involved, but his heart had
sturdily driven his mind to seek in every other direction
before it should turn to the one being in all the
world whom Ben Emeal loved, but no less the one
being in all his household who, he knew, would dare
to question or oppose the established order of things.
This was a serious charge and no one realized the
seriousness of it, coming from one of the wise men
of the Faith, more than did Ben Emeal; yet his love
for his only son and his confidence in his own ability
to deal with such a subject in connection with that
son, led him to have little anxiety, in spite of the
warning.</p>

<p>It was not possible that Ahmed could have met
the infidel! Where could he even have heard of
anything different from the doctrine of his father's
Faith? It was absurd! Of late Ben Emeal had noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>a tendency in his son to question him upon
subjects of life and religion; and, too, he had seen
the boy several times sitting quiet as if in deep
thought, an unusual attitude for a healthy, hearty
youth; but he had supposed these things only the
passing freaks of young manhood. For some time
past Ahmed had sought to avoid marriage and he
had never seemed to care for the pleasures of the
harem; these things, too, were unusual, but Ben
Emeal recognized in his idolized son the beginnings
of an unusual man and was proud of him accordingly.</p>

<p>A merry voice just beyond the purdah suddenly
interrupted the father's thoughts and the curtain was
lifted to admit a young man about eighteen years of
age, of striking build and comeliness. With a gay
and winning greeting the young fellow dropped upon
the cushions beside the older man and soon Ben
Emeal had forgotten his doubts in a lively discussion
of the approaching durbar and the ceremonies attendant
upon that function.</p>

<p>But, after a pleasant hour together, just as they
were about to separate for a brief siesta, Ahmed
turned to his father with a slight frown and said:</p>

<p>"Just before I came in this afternoon I met out
here in the street before our house the strangest old
man! He wore that dress that you call Arabian, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>think, and he had on the green of our Prophet's kin,
but he was staggering along the street muttering,
'The night is coming! Desolation is coming upon
us!' or something like that. I went up to him to
see if I could help him, and, also, to see if a kin of
our Prophet could really have been drinking of the
accursed cup; but I found no signs of intoxication
about him, only signs of intense fear as he cowered
against the wall, repeating his cry of desolation.
Adjed, the silversmith, came up just then and took
him in charge or I should have found out more
about him. Strange, wasn't it? It really gave me
an uncanny feeling as if it were a premonition of
some danger," and the young man shook himself as
if to shake off a lingering feeling of fear.</p>

<p>Ben Emeal's face, as his son spoke, resumed the
troubled expression which had been driven away by
Ahmed's former lively conversation and he said to
the lad very solemnly as they both rose and he put a
hand on the youth's shoulder:</p>

<p>"My son, you never forget, do you, that first of
all in this world you are a follower of the true
Prophet and that your first business in life is to convert
or destroy the infidel?"</p>

<p>The son did not reply except with another question.
"Father, can I not go to the university at
Aligarh to learn more of our Faith?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span></p><p>"I will see; I will see, my son," replied the father
genially and his face cleared as if the question had
put his fears at rest.</p>

<p>"I will see, my son," he said again as he turned
to the door leading to his own apartment where he
would take a few pulls at the hookah before he
should give himself up to his afternoon rest.</p>

<p>Ahmed went to his mother's chamber where with
his head upon her knee, her proud eyes gazing
down upon the handsome face of her son, the
dearest possession of an Indian woman's life, and her
loving fingers smoothing his rich, dark hair back
from his brow, he fell very soon into the refreshing
sleep of youth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Ahmed awoke from his restful sleep, he
found his mother still supporting his head and still
gazing fondly down into his face. For a few moments
he lay, returning her smiles. Suddenly his
face clouded.</p>

<p>"Mother, why is it that you can never leave this
house, this walled-in courtyard; why is it that you
cannot ride out with me in the open and look upon
the trees and the grass and the blue sky? It does
not seem right that I should be allowed to look upon
all these things and you not."</p>

<p>"Hush, my son!" answered his mother. "It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>the law of the Prophet. What he commands must
be right. But, see, there is the blue sky, and here
are my green tree and my grass and sometimes I
even may ride out in an ekka and peep through the
curtains, and once, my son, many years ago, I rode
on a railway train and saw through the shutters
miles and miles of green grass and flowers and so
many, many beautiful things that I shall always be
happy because of that sight."</p>

<p>Ahmed looked from the beautiful but sad face of
his mother up at the patch of sky bounded by the
four gray, brick walls; he looked at the lone, gray-green
tree trying to grow in a foot or two of garden
in the middle of the paved courtyard, and at the
grass, already giving up its struggle for life, about its
roots, and his heart ached for this lonely woman.
For he knew that although she was his father's only
wife at present, because she had borne him, Ahmed,
to Ben Emeal, he knew that she saw little of his
father, for there were many concubines in the home
who not only usurped her place in her husband's life
but who, also, in many, many ways made her life far
from happy in the home. He knew that really he
himself was her only joy and comfort and he rebelled.
Ahmed had been taught that a woman has
no soul. Did he doubt the words of his teachers as
he gazed into his mother's eyes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span></p><p>"Mother, why are you called 'Ahmed's mother'
instead of your own name when the people of the
household speak to you? Why are you so 'blest
in' me as they say?"</p>

<p>"Because, my son&mdash;surely you must know by this
time that a woman is no better than a beast; 'a
cow' the Prophet calls her; and that she can only
enjoy life through the son that she bears. Ah, how
rich I am in you! But suppose you had not come
to me, Ahmed, my son!" and her face became
drawn with the thought. "Suppose I had been as
my sister who has no son!"</p>

<p>The youth could not bear to add to his mother's
unhappiness by having her dwell upon such
thoughts and so he playfully pulled down her face
and kissed her and teased her to show him the
wedding garments which she was embroidering for
him.</p>

<p>"When is it to be?" he asked.</p>

<p>"After the month of fasting, my son."</p>

<p>"Is she beautiful?"</p>

<p>"I know not, my son. But surely she must be for
such a handsome man as thou art."</p>

<p>"Dost thou want me to have a wife, mother?"</p>

<p>The mother's face was crossed with a spasm of pain
at the question, for when his wedding came, she felt
that she would have lost her son, her only joy in life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>She knew that she had such a son as few mothers in
all India and she knew that their loving relationship
and companionship was very unusual. But he
must marry and as a woman she must not show
grief; in fact, being a woman, she had no grief. So
she mastered her pain in a second and replied, but
not so quickly that it deceived Ahmed:</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, as every true follower of the
Prophet must, so must thou marry and beget sons.
But thou canst still love thy mother a little," she
added shyly.</p>

<p>"That I will," affirmed the son blithely. "But,"
he went on crossly, "I don't want to marry and be
bothered with a wife. Mother, I'll tell you what I
really want to do. I want to go to our university at
Aligarh where I can learn all about our Faith and
about everything else, mother. I want to be a great
man."</p>

<p>"Not a great man, my son, but a great follower of
the Prophet! Why, the sky has clouded and there
comes some rain!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! I must get me up and away, for I
promised a friend I would come and read with him
for a time."</p>

<p>"Is it The Book, my son?"</p>

<p>"No, mother, it is something new which some one
gave him one time on the train. We have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>reading it together for months now. It is very
beautiful, all about Jesus who is coming at the end
of the world, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, my son, for I have read The
Book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is strange, mother, that you can read, for
Elid's mother cannot, nor can any woman in Ajar's
household, he says, nor can any other woman in this,"
interrupted the son. "And besides, mother, the
other young men I know never seem to spend any
time with their mothers at all or talk to them or even
love them, it seems to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, it is strange, for ours is not the ordinary
life, nor has my lot been the ordinary lot of
woman here. My father taught me to read when I
was a little child, for he became blind and then I
could read to him, for I was quicker and more willing
to do it than the boys. My father was a great
scholar and I know The Book by heart, but little joy
has come to me since my marriage for my knowledge,"
she sighed. "Your father respects me no more
than he does his latest concubine. I have respect
here only because of you, my son," and her eyes
feasted upon his fair countenance. "Go now, my
son, to thy friend, but beware of new things, for
what is new often offends the Faith." With these
words she left Ahmed as he lifted the purdah, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>followed him as far as her woman's feet were
permitted to go.</p>

<p>But Ahmed trod on through the narrow streets, although
the rain was pouring, for he did not want to
miss the reading which was giving him such a different
outlook upon life. Why, really, it was a "blasphemous
thought," but this new book seemed to
him to be greater than the Koran. It had given him
such a new vision. Never had he thought much
about his mother's life and position before reading
this book, but now his mind was quickened to understand
her condition. This book said, "Honour
thy father and thy mother," and it did not seem to
exclude woman from any joys, even those of Paradise.
He was so eager to know more, especially
since the conversation with his mother that afternoon,
that he wondered if his friend would let him
take the book home with him to study by himself.</p>

<p>As Ahmed went on in the rain his thoughts
turned from the new book to a man whom he had
met several times the past year outside the walls of
Hyderabad on the big bridge. The man's peculiar
bearing of kindness towards any one in trouble and
his happy face had attracted the youth. They had
talked together once or twice and the man whom
Ahmed supposed to be a Hindu had told him that
he was a Hindu no longer, but a follower of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>"Jesus Doctrine." The boy had wondered what it
could mean, for never had he been so drawn to a
stranger as he had to that man whose whole thought
had seemed to be how he could help some one else.
One day Ahmed saw this man actually help a woman
place her water jar on her head and a moment later
get down in the dust of the road and help a coolie
pile up again a mass of fuel <a name="trans_dung-cakes" id="trans_dung-cakes"></a>dung-cakes which had
been knocked over by a passing cart; and yet this
man was a scholar, as Ahmed knew by his conversation,
and no outcast. The boy wondered as he
thought it over now if the new book which he had
been reading could have any connection with what
this man had called the "Jesus Doctrine." The more
he thought about it the more it seemed to him that
that man's actions had been the carrying out of the
precepts of the new book.</p>

<p>Ahmed had not paid much heed to his steps as he
had splashed along in the rain, trying as far as possible
to keep under the protection of the buildings
from the rain which seemed to be coming in
torrents from the south. He was wrapped in his
thoughts.</p>

<p>But suddenly his steps were stayed, for he heard a
weird, awful cry, and in a corner of the porch of the
house that he was passing he saw a figure on its knees
in prayer. The attitude was conventional and in no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>way terrifying, but the words and voice had startled
him.</p>

<p>"Night is coming! The wildness of desolation
will soon be upon us! Oh, Allah, Allah, hear the
cry of the faithful!"</p>

<p>The voice was that of one whose soul was in
mortal agony, and as Ahmed stooped to look more
closely, he recognized the old man whose voice he
had heard a few hours before in front of his own
door. He recognized, too, that the place where he
was standing was the crossing of the Sidar Ways, a
place a long distance from the road he had thought
he was taking.</p>

<p>He wondered what could have alarmed the old
man, but, really frightened at the repetition of the
awful words and the tone of the agonized voice, the
young fellow did not go to the man's side, but hastened
to find a return way to his friend's, whose home
he had missed in the rain and the preoccupation of
his thoughts. As he turned, for the first time he
noticed that another man was standing close behind
him. In the semi-darkness, he did not recognize
him, but gave him the greeting of the Faith and hurried
on. As he reached his friend's door, it gave the
boy a queer, uncomfortable feeling to perceive that
this same man was still behind him.</p>

<p>An hour or so later Ahmed emerged from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>house with the precious book concealed in his clothing,
for his friend had warned him that he feared
that a good Mohammedan would not read it and that
he believed that it was the book of another faith.
As such his friend had decided that he would read
it no more. But Ahmed had said that it mattered
not to him what faith it was, he thought it beautiful
and he wanted to read it still more. So instead of
permitting his friend to burn it as he had wanted to
do, Ahmed had insisted upon taking it to his home
for further study.</p>

<p>He did not notice as he left Elid's house that a
man slipped out from the shadows and followed him
to his own door. Nor did he know that this man
turned as soon as he had entered the house and
made haste back to the crossing of the Sidar Ways
where he aroused the strange old man from his paroxysm
of fear and talked earnestly with him for
some time.</p>

<p>Within his mother's room by the light of the oil
lamp Ahmed read and read, while his mother
watched him and sewed on the wedding garments.
Too engrossed to read aloud or even talk about what
he was reading, he read on and on. Long after his
mother had given up her vain efforts to get him to
go to rest and had rolled herself in her blanket, he
still bent over the book. He read until sleep finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>blurred his mind and closed his eyes and the lamp
burned out at his side.</p>

<p>But Ahmed had noticed before he slept a name on
the first page of the book, "Mission Press, Bangalore,
India." It must be that those people could explain
to him what this book meant. If he could only go
to them! Never had words written or spoken
stirred his heart as it had been stirred by this book.
It must be of Allah and yet in all he had read he
had found no mention of the Prophet. Since Elid's
warning Ahmed seemed to feel that perhaps in reading
this book and thinking these thoughts he was
betraying the Faith, and yet, if all this he had been
reading were true, it was better than the Faith and
he could no longer believe as he had before.</p>

<p>Could he in any way get to that "Mission Press"
in Bangalore? Ahmed had never been but a few
miles from Hyderabad; indeed, that was one reason
why he had wanted to go to the university at Aligarh
and another reason was that in the last few
months he had begun to be dissatisfied with the
Faith and thought that there they could certainly
explain all to him. But now he preferred to go to
Bangalore. It seemed as if he must go there: but
instinctively he felt that he must conceal his reason
for wishing to go. And so with his mind confused
by these thoughts and the new ideas which the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>book had brought him, ideas utterly foreign to all
he had known before, he fell into a restless sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It seemed to Ahmed as if some unseen force were
ordering events when early on the next day he was
called to his father's presence to find him unexpectedly
ill and so ill that it would be impossible for him
to leave the city and go to Bangalore on a very important
matter of business. Ben Emeal could trust
the business to no assistant and yet it had to be attended
to on the next day. The only person whom
he could trust was his son and that son until then
had been not only ignorant of all business matters
but also of travel, having never made a journey
alone on a railway train. But when Ben Emeal saw
that there was no other way to save to his name
several thousands of rupees, he decided to give his
son a rather hurried and, indeed, trying initiation
into commercial life. The old Arab's warning
against the infidel had not been forgotten, but the
father did not think the risk too great to send his
son away alone for the first time, as he thought the
novelty of the journey and of assisting in business affairs
for the first time would keep Ahmed's mind
from dangerous thoughts, and besides,&mdash;it was a
matter of much money.</p>

<p>So Ahmed had been summoned to his father's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>presence and instructed in all the matters needful to
the transaction of the business. When Ben Emeal
saw the delight and eagerness with which the boy
undertook the journey and the task given him he
did not consider it necessary even to warn him
against the possible meeting with the infidel in
Bangalore.</p>

<p>So Ahmed had started for the very place of all
others that he wanted to visit, sent by his father&mdash;such
a strange answer to the longings of the night
before that he was filled with a feeling of awe. So
impressed with the religious importance of this journey
and with a divine ordering of it was he that he
scarcely appreciated its novelty. Because of his ignorance
of travel, his father had directed him to go
first class; therefore, he had the compartment to
himself for the whole journey and, since this was so,
instead of gazing from the window and enjoying the
new sights as he would have done a few days before,
now he pulled out the new book and read the whole
journey through.</p>

<p>Although Ahmed had but one desire when he
reached Bangalore, that of finding the "Mission
Press," he went first, as he knew was right, and
transacted the business entrusted to him. When
that was over, then he began his search for the people
who were responsible for "The Book." No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>longer did that title in Ahmed's mind belong to the
Koran and for some reason or other he did not seek
these people to be told that what The Book said was
true; for he seemed to know himself that it was true,
but he sought them for more knowledge and for an
explanation of many things that he could not understand,
and especially to find out the relation of the
Prophet to it all, as Mohammed was not mentioned
in The Book.</p>

<p>Ahmed found the Mission Press to be a large
brick building set back in a grassy compound.
When, with a desire for secrecy which he could not
exactly explain, he dismissed his gari at some distance
from the gate and made the approach on foot,
he was surprised to see another Mohammedan stop
at the gate, but he did not recognize in him the man
who had followed him from the crossing of the
Sidar Ways to his friend's house the night before in
Hyderabad.</p>

<p>So without anxiety other than that which possessed
him to learn of the new book, Ahmed entered
the big building. Never having seen a press
and not exactly knowing what the word implied, he
was amazed at the whirring machinery and the offices
of busy clerks. At a window he told his errand
in a simple, straightforward way, pointing to the
name of the press on the title page of The Book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>which he had drawn from under his clothing. The
converted Hindu at the window at once led the boy
to a small room within, where sat an American
gentleman literally buried in manuscripts, proof
sheets, and correspondence. But a quick resurrection
took place at the clerk's whispered words and
the American, a missionary, arose to greet the youth.</p>

<p>For several hours they talked and prayed, each
moment separating Ahmed farther from the faith of
his father and drawing him closer to the faith taught
by a stranger. Since the boy was not to return to
Hyderabad until the next day, when the press closed
for the night he went home to the mission compound
with the missionary. And so engrossed was
he in conversing with his new friend that he did not
see that a man followed them all the way from the
press building, indeed, the same man whom he had
seen at the gate.</p>

<p>It was not late in the evening when in the midst
of their conversation, Ahmed turned abruptly to his
missionary host and said, "I believe. I want to be
a Christian. What must I do?"</p>

<p>The missionary explained to him that the next
step after belief was testimony, a testimony usually
given by baptism, but that Ahmed could not think
of being baptized until he had prayed long and
earnestly over the matter. Indeed, it might mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>death to him, for he himself must surely know the
bitterness of the Prophet's followers. It would
probably mean at the very least disinheritance and
banishment from his father's home.</p>

<p>"But I believe," cried Ahmed, "and if testimony
is necessary for believers of this 'Jesus Doctrine,'
then I must testify; I must be baptized."</p>

<p>But the missionary was firm and although his
heart glowed at the courage of the young man, little
more than a boy, he would not yield but sent
Ahmed to the guest-chamber with the counsel to
pray about it.</p>

<p>And for hours that night did Ahmed pray.</p>

<p>When, in the early morning, he met the missionary
in the drawing-room, his resolve was unchanged
and his request of the evening before was
repeated. "Baptize me now. I must be baptized
for I must testify to the world that I believe," he
said. His face shone with such a happy light as he
pleaded that the missionary felt that no longer could
he refuse to administer the sacrament asked for.</p>

<p>"But it may mean death," again he urged.</p>

<p>"Jesus died for me; you yourself have told me,"
replied Ahmed.</p>

<p>"You will certainly lose your inheritance and be
an exile from your family."</p>

<p>"He gave up His inheritance in the skies and took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>exile upon Himself that He might bring life to me;
can I not do as much in testifying for Him?"</p>

<p>How the lad had learned so much of the Gospel
and the very words of the Bible in such a short time
was a marvel to the American preacher, but he did
not know with what intensity the hungry heart of
the youth had been studying the sacred pages.</p>

<p>It seemed to the missionary, therefore, that it
must be God's will that the young Mohammedan
should be baptized. But he wanted it to be done in
the presence of the congregation.</p>

<p>"When could that be?" asked Ahmed.</p>

<p>"Not for three days," replied the preacher.</p>

<p>"But I must go to my home to-day!" exclaimed
the young man.</p>

<p>"Ahmed," the missionary's eyes were filled with
perplexity and suffering, "Ahmed, it will be sure death
if you go back to Hyderabad, I know. Will you
not let me send you north where you can probably
escape from notice until you have studied and are
ready to preach the Gospel? Then you can come
back and perhaps preach in safety to your people,"
he urged. "Wait here in secret in my home until
the Sabbath. Then after the public service and
public baptism before the congregation, I will spirit
you away and you will be safe."</p>

<p>The young man drew himself to his full height
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>and his eyes glowed. "My father expects me to
start for home to-night. I must obey. He has
given me his trust. But more than that, I must
hasten to tell them of what I have found&mdash;to tell my
mother of a God who loves her and that she is not
lost, but can be saved by believing in Jesus. I
know that I shall die, but before then I shall have
lived enough, if I succeed in taking the message to
them. Can I not be baptized now, at once?"</p>

<p>It was not in the missionary's province to detain
such a messenger. With a tap of the bell he
assembled the family for morning prayers, the
heathen as well as the Christian servants attending,
and in their presence he baptized Ahmed, the young
Mohammedan, no longer a follower of the Prophet
but of the Christ.</p>

<p>As the missionary with his hand upon Ahmed's
bowed head repeated the words in Hindustani, "I
baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Ghost," a Mohammedan glided
from behind the draperies of a side window, through
the half-opened shutters, and passed quickly and
noiselessly down the driveway and through the compound
gate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just before the gates of the city closed for the
night the train from Bangalore deposited Ahmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>at the station and he was safe within the walls of
Hyderabad. He hastened through the narrow, dark
streets to his own home, shunning the crowded
bazaars and picking out the winding byways that
lead between the high walls of the residence portion
of the city near the river. A foreigner would not
have imagined that the walls confining the dirty
lanes within their narrow limits were the walls of the
homes of some of the rich and influential Mohammedans
of the great city. But so it was, for the
barren, outward appearance of an oriental residence
does not reveal the luxury within; and, besides,
many of these Eastern people seem to prefer the
luxury of costly jewels and raiment to that of beautiful
surroundings and live on in the plain ways of the
poorer natives with only the number of servants, the
elegance of their dress, their indolence, and their
indulgence in pleasures showing their wealth.</p>

<p>Such was the home of Ahmed, plain, satisfying
only the requirements of a simple native life. It
covered much ground, for the number of servants
and concubines demanded considerable room even
for plain housing. But there was little display of
wealth within except in the wearing of gold-embroidered
robes and precious jewels. Only a succession
of bare paved courtyards, with open and closed
rooms at the sides, made up the house all practically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>unadorned except one in the centre of the house
which was gorgeous in carving and inlaid work and
faced a tiny, open mosque, also richly ornamented.
The mosque was a most beautiful example of Indian
skill in carving and stone work and about the niche
which pointed towards Mecca were many passages
from the Koran, inlaid in the marble with precious
stones in a most delicate and marvellous way. Before
the niche upon the marble floor were spread
prayer rugs of great price. This was the private
mosque of Ben Emeal and his household and he
had thought the expenditure of thousands of rupees
not too much for the adornment of his place of prayer.</p>

<p>When Ahmed reached home, the servants told
him that his father was at prayer in the mosque and
did not wish to be disturbed before morning.
Ahmed wondered what unusual happening could
have called his father to a whole night of prayer.
When he asked the servant more particularly about
his father's health, he found that Ben Emeal had
seemed much better until in the afternoon a strange
old Arab had been admitted to his presence and
since then he had been much worse, depressed in
mind as well as body, and at times greatly agitated.</p>

<p>Ahmed, feeling that he must not interrupt his father
at such a time and wondering if it could be possible
that his father's agitated condition could have come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>from a premonition of what he himself had done,
hastened to his mother's apartment. Finding her
asleep, he spent several hours in prayer for help and
guidance for the coming day, for he knew that he
could not and would not put off the revelation of his
break with his father's faith longer than that, unless
Ben Emeal's illness should grow more alarming.</p>

<p>Meantime the rain had come again, even harder
than upon the night that Ahmed had been abroad.
In floods it was pouring down upon the city of
Hyderabad and brimming the banks of the river.
In a small house near the great bridge that spanned
the river at the crossing of the Sidar Ways two men
were sitting. One was the man who had been following
the doings of Ahmed; the other, the old
man from Arabia, whose face now reflected no
terror, only the glow of a fanatic Faith.</p>

<p>"He was baptized?" As he almost shouted the
question, the old man leaned forward in his excitement.
"I warned the father again this day in a
manner that stirred him to the depths, but I did not
really expect this so soon. Are you sure? Have
you told our brothers of the council?"</p>

<p>The other replied, "Why, of course I am sure,
for I saw the act myself. Yes, I have reported to
Ben Isah and he bade me tell you that just before
noon we are to assemble with Ben Emeal and support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>his arm and his faith as followers of the
Prophet. Of course the boy will recant and repudiate
all this nonsense, he says, but he must be taught
a severe lesson. 'There must be no trifling with the
infidel,' were his very words."</p>

<p>As the man ceased speaking a gust of wind bore
the rain like sleet against the door of the house and
the old man looked up with a hunted expression and
his lips moved as if in prayer. The younger man
looked at him in contempt and without another
word threw himself upon a charpoy in the corner of
the room and fell asleep, but the old man sank on
his knees and remained in that position until dawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ahmed's first thought with the coming of the new
day was to tell his mother the good news and bring
joy to her sad heart. Then he had determined that
he would face his father and leave the rest in God's
hands. His mother might lose her son, but she
would gain far more in what this Jesus Doctrine
would bring. So he greeted her with a happy heart.</p>

<p>He told her all: of his own experience, his growing
dissatisfaction with Mohammedanism, of his
growing belief in the religion of the new book
which he had studied for so many months, of his
occasional meetings with the Christian man at the
bridge, and, finally, of what he had done at Bangalore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>Words could not come fast enough as he went
on to explain the new faith to her and told her what
it would mean for her, if she should believe. But, although
it sounded very beautiful to her, she could
not accept any doctrine in such a short time and she
was listening to his words as yet with only a glad
wonder in her heart, when a messenger suddenly
summoned him to his father.</p>

<p>Ahmed had almost forgotten his father in his
eagerness to talk to his mother and bring her the
good news; so he was remorseful when suddenly he
realized that he had not even asked about his father's
health since the night before, nor gone to him to report
on the business matter which he had arranged
in Bangalore. He went quickly after the messenger,
for the moment again forgetful of the unwelcome
news that he must bring to his father soon. He was
surprised when he learned from the servant that Ben
Emeal was still in the mosque and awaited him
there. But his surprise became amazement when on
entering the mosque he perceived a circle of the
most influential Mohammedans of Hyderabad seated
about his father on the floor. So accustomed was
Ahmed to the habits of the faithful that without
thought of its being a violation of his new faith, he
slipped his feet from his shoes as he entered the mosque.</p>

<p>As Ahmed approached the group he noticed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>one side of his father the old Arab whom he had
seen in such terror upon the street and at the other
side the man whom he had met at the gate of the
Mission Press in Bangalore. In a flash, as his eyes
met those of the man who had spied upon him and
saw the light of success in them, Ahmed understood
the reason for this assemblage and for his being summoned
thus as it were before a tribunal of the faithful.
Instinctively his eyes sought his father and the
drawn, haggard look upon that face, usually so
strong and firm, rent his heart. Their eyes met and
in a second each had read the message that the other
loved him, come what might. Then the eyes of both
fell and the lad awaited the charge.</p>

<p>"Ben Isah," the voice of the man who had dogged
Ahmed's footsteps demanded, "is it seemly that an
infidel should stand within the sacred precincts of a
house of prayer?"</p>

<p>"Ben Idrahi," replied the most dignified and grave
gentleman of the company as if he were a judge in
a court and repeating the formulas of that august
body;&mdash;and, indeed, he was a judge in a court that
controlled life and death; "Ben Idrahi, whom accuseth
thou of being an infidel? Are not all of us before
you true followers of the Prophet and upholders
of the only true Faith? Whom accuseth thou with
such a terrible accusation?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span></p><p>"Ben Isah," the man rose and said slowly, "I
have proof; I have proof, I say, that the youth,
Ahmed, son of Ben Emeal, is no longer a follower of
the Prophet; that in the city of Bangalore yesterday
in the early morning he was baptized into the hell-filling
creed, the name of which I will not defile my
lips with. And now, Brothers of the Faith, he
stands before you an avowed infidel."</p>

<p>As the man announced the fact of his baptism in
Bangalore, although Ahmed dared not look at his
father, he felt that an involuntary shudder passed
over Ben Emeal's frame. But at those words his
own heart leaped and yearned towards these men.
Then and there he longed to tell them the wonderful
story of the God revealed through Jesus Christ, but
he restrained himself.</p>

<p>Ben Isah had turned towards him and all eyes except
his father's were upon him, as the older man said:</p>

<p>"Ahmed, son of Ben Emeal, is this, that this man
accuseth thee of, is this true?"</p>

<p>Ahmed could restrain himself no longer. This
was his opportunity to testify and to men who probably
would never hear the message from other lips.
He took the opportunity with a skill and wisdom beyond
his years.</p>

<p>The words poured from his lips, even as the rain
was pouring from the heavens into the courtyard of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>the mosque. His face glowed and his eyes shone
with a light brighter than that of the clouded sun.
Not a man moved. They listened, held by the fascination
of the youth, as with a tempestuousness that
seemed born of the very storm without and with a
courage not born of man, he told them the truth as
they would never hear it again.</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyes were upon his father's face,
who looked as if he were beholding a miracle. When
he had finished, his hands still outstretched, his voice
still ringing in their ears as he said,&mdash;"All that this
man says is true. I am an infidel, as you say, for I
have been baptized. I am a Christian,"&mdash;Ben Isah
stumbled to his feet and with shaking hand held out,
cried in agitated voice: "Stop! Stop him! This
must cease! This must cease! Lay hands upon
him! Take him from the mosque!"</p>

<p>Confusion reigned as a couple of men seized
Ahmed's arms and dragged him from the mosque
while the other men raved at him in rage and hate
because in spite of themselves they had listened to a
blasphemer and the teachings of the infidel. The lad
was carried to a side chamber where the two men
stood over him, giving him no chance to escape.
But Ahmed was not seeking that; his head was
bowed in prayer.</p>

<p>As they watched and waited the two men talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>of the storm without, for the rain still fell in torrents
and the wind blew; while above the sound of the
wind and rain could be heard continuously the voice
of the gorged and angry river.</p>

<p>"If this continues, there will be trouble," said one,
"for this morning the water was five feet higher than
yesterday, they told me."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other, "when I crossed the
bridge a few hours ago the river was up to the first
buttress; but there can't be any real danger, can
there?"</p>

<p>"It must be a warning to the infidel," answered
the first, looking significantly at Ahmed, but he was
unconscious of what they were saying.</p>

<p>Soon the summons came and the lad was led into
a large guest-chamber where his father received
visitors of state. The men sat as before in the
mosque, but their faces were dark and their eyes
downcast.</p>

<p>Again Ben Isah spoke, "Young man, because of
thy youth, and for thy father's sake, we will give
thee one chance, one only, to recant and unsay all
thou hast said. Wilt thou take back thy words, repudiate
this infidelity, and once more accept the true
and only Faith?"</p>

<p>Before Ahmed could reply Ben Emeal was upon
his feet. "My son," he said in slow, restrained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>tones, "think well before thou speakest. Remember
thou art my only son; remember that all my fortune
will be thine. Thou canst go to the University at
Aligarh; thou canst have thy heart's desire in everything,
if thou wilt only recant!" He ended hurriedly.</p>

<p>"If thou dost not, Ahmed, son of Emeal," shrilled
the old Arab, rising to his feet, "thou shalt die.
Choose thou and choose quickly!"</p>

<p>The son looked at the father. Just then in the
distance, through the downfall of the rain, there
sounded dimly:</p>

<p>"Allah is most great! Allah is most great! Allah
is most great! Allah is most great! I bear
witness that there is no god but Allah! I bear witness
that there is no god but Allah! I bear witness
that Mohammed is the Apostle of Allah! I bear
witness that Mohammed is the Apostle of Allah!
Come to prayer, come to prayer! Come to the
Refuge, come to the Refuge! Allah is most great!
Allah is most great! There is no god but Allah!"</p>

<p>It was the Moslem's call to prayer and every man
in the room fell upon his knees except Ahmed.</p>

<p>Ahmed remained standing with bowed head. He
made no effort to escape while the others were upon
their knees. But as soon as they had finished their
devotions, he stepped forward and in a clear, full voice
said simply, "I choose death."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span></p><p>A silence as of death itself fell upon the company.
No one spoke. The boy remained standing with his
hands out as he had spoken. At a motion from Ben
Isah a servant stole to Ben Emeal's side and noiselessly
placed a cup in his hands. The latter arose
and stepped towards his son.</p>

<p>With a stern, tense voice Ben Emeal broke the
silence: "The infidel must die! This is the cup of
death. Drink!"</p>

<p>As he touched the cup to his son's lips a thunder
as of mighty waters rose.</p>

<p>"Night is coming! The wildness of desolation
is upon us! Fly, fly!" shrieked the voice of the old
Arab. But even as he cried a wave of water burst
into the room through the open door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The river rose sixty feet above the bridge they say
and at least ten thousand of the inhabitants of Hyderabad
were drowned in that one day.</p>

<p>In one room in the house that had been Ben
Emeal's, when the water subsided, they found as
many as fifteen or twenty bodies and since most of
them wore the Mohammedan rosary, all were given
decent burial according to the customs of the followers
of the Prophet. Thus an infidel was interred in
holy ground and allowed to sleep beside his father.</p>

<p>"This volume is a little window opened into the life and

Kalgan, the northern gateway of China, that a mission
station was begun amid a people hard and unimpressible.
It was here that Mrs. Williams won the hearts of Chinese
women and girls; here that she showed what a Christian
home may be, and how the children of such a home can be
trained for wide and unselfish usefulness wherever their lot
is cast. No object-lesson is more needed in the Celestial Empire
than this. Many glimpses of that patient and tireless missionary
activity which makes itself all things to all men are
given."&mdash;<i>Arthur H. Smith, Author of Chinese Characteristics,

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
